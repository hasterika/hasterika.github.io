Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.
