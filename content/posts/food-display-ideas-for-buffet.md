The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.

Conclusion:
Creative art doesn't have to be expensive or time-consuming. There are many ways to create beautiful pieces of art without much effort. Here are three simple tips: 
1) Start with a basic idea. What are your favorite pieces of art and why? How can you improve on them without having to spend a lot of money? 
2) Use your creativity. Take advantage of what you know about your subject matter. If you're an artist, you know how to paint! Why not use that knowledge to make something new and interesting? 
3) Experiment. Change things up until you find something that works well for you. Be creative and open-minded; it'll make the process more fun and fulfilling!
