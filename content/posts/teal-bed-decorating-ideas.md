The future of work: What will society be like without jobs?
In 2020, many people are likely to believe that the future of work is one where machines take over most tasks. This is due to the mounting evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more advanced, and will soon be able to outperform humans in many tasks. With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work. Some companies are already using AI tools to help employees learn new skills and knowledge, while others are using it as a way to outsource certain jobs or reduce costs. Whatever the case may be, the future of work looks bleak without jobs.
