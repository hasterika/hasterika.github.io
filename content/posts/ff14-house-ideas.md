The impact of creativity on art: How does creativity affect the artist?
Creativity is a vital force in the artist’s life. Without creativity, art would be little more than phantasy or dreams. It has been said that creativity is the ability to see things in a new light and to take risks. In order to be truly creative, an artist must have an outlet for their ideas and must be willing to experiment. Some artists rely solely on their own intuition, while others need help from others in order to get started. The impact of creativity on art is complex and difficult to study fully, but there are some general patterns that can be discerned. First and foremost, creativity often leads to innovation and change. This can lead to new ways of looking at old ideas or can result in the discovery of hitherto unknown aspects of the arts. Secondarily, creativity produces fresh perspectives on what has already been done.

How is innovation used in the business world?
Innovation is a key component of business success, as it can help businesses improve their products or services, increase sales, and even create new markets. However, it can also be challenging to manage innovation effectively, which is why companies often rely on outside experts to help them work on projects. 
While there are many different ways that innovation is used in the business world, three main methods are structural, process, and product/service system innovations. Structural innovations help businesses change their symbols or branding to create a new standard in the industry. Process innovations can make it easier for customers to order or buy products online or through phone calls. Product/service system innovations can allow companies to improve the overall efficiency of their operations by making changes to their entire supply chain.
