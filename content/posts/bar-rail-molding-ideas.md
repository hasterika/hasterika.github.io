The art of creativity: What artists do and why they do it
Creativity is a wide and varied term, but it typically refers to the ability of artists to produce new works of art. This can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, photography, etc. but also in the form of ideas or concepts that are not necessarily physical. In many ways, creativity is an innate quality that all humans possess. It is something that is passed down from one generation to the next and something that can be cultivated through practice and hard work. While some people may find creativity a challenge to achieve, for others it can be a source of inspiration and guidance.
