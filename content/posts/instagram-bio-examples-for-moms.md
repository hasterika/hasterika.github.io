getting feedback: How do you get feedback for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get feedback for your work. However, getting feedback can be difficult. There are a number of ways to get feedback and it depends on the person you are talking to. Here are some tips:
1. Take notes when you have thoughts or ideas. This will help you remember what you want to say later and also give you feedback on how your idea is sounding.

2. Get someone else to listen to your ideas. If you only have yourself to talk to, it can be tough getting feedback because it may not be clear what is wanted from the conversation. Get someone else who will understand the idea and can give feedback that is helpful.

3. Talk about your ideas with others before starting anything new.

Ideas are a great source of inspiration and can be used in different ways to improve someone's life. Sometimes, ideas can be used for good, such as creating a new idea for a project, coming up with a new plan to improve upon an old one, or finding a new way to do something. Other times, ideas can be used for bad, such as inventing a new product that no one will ever buy, or coming up with a plan to fail at something.
