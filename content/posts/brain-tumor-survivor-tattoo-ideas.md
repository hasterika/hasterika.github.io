Definition of invention: What is it and what does it mean for society?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something existing. It can be anything from a new product to a new idea for a business. Inventions have a big impact on society because they can change the way we live and work. They can also create new opportunities for businesses and people.
One of the key definitions for invention is "a means of producing something which had not been produced before, or that is different from what has been produced previously." This definition encompasses everything from products to ideas to methods of transportation. Inventors are often incredibly creative and come up with amazing ideas that could change the world. Without invention, there would likely be very few innovations in our lives.

Invention has played an important role in human history since prehistoric times. For example, early humans used tools to make their way through life and get food and shelter.
