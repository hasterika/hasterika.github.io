What makes good ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any creative team. They provide the spark that ignites new ideas and inspires others to come up with their own. Without good ideas, your team may lack the energy or motivation to continue working on a project. It's important to be able to come up with great ideas, even if they're not easy to execute. Here are six tips to help you get started: 1) Be open-minded: No one is perfect and every idea is different. When you're evaluating an idea, don't be afraid to give it some time and test it out before committing yourself fully. 2) Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem difficult or unappreciated. Keep at it until you've cracked the code for creating great ideas.
