The Future of Work: How will work change in the future?
According to many experts, the future of work is one in which employees are able to work from home, commute less, and enjoy other forms of leisure. While these changes may sound like good news for workers, they also present some challenges. For example, if people are able to work from home while they have children or elderly parents around, this can lead to tension and stress at home. Additionally, working from home can also lead to a lack of social interaction and communication with coworkers. These concerns make it difficult for companies to determine if the benefits of using remote working platforms outweigh the potential drawbacks. In order to figure out the future of work, companies will need to consider not only the benefits but also the risks.

The four steps to creating ideas: problem solving, coming up with a good title, writing a proposal, and taking action.
1. Get clear about what you want to achieve. What are your goals? What is the problem that you want to solve? 
2. Brainstorm a group of people who can help you develop your ideas. This can be a group of friends, family, or co-workers. 
3. Brainstorm a title for your project. This will give you an idea of what your project will be called and help organize all the different parts of your project together. 
4. Write out your proposal for potential investors or clients. This will give them a detailed account of what you plan to do and why itâ€™s important for them to invest in your project.
