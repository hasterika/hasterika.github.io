The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.
Some people are naturally more creative than others, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t harness our own creativity. There are a number of things we can do to nurture our creativity, including:

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?

Creative processes: How do you go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come in any form, whether it’s coming up with a new product, idea for a new show, or even just a new way to look at something. Whether you want to come up with something original or simply reuse an existing idea, there are some key processes that you need to follow when coming up with creative ideas. 
The first step is to think about what you want your product or show to be. Once you have this idea in mind, it’s important to brainstorm different ways that you can make it happen. This could mean looking at different concepts and seeing which ones appeal to you the most, or exploring other possibilities and seeing which ones work best for your project.
