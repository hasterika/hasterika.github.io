Main Points: New ideas can improve things like productivity, happiness, and social interaction.
The research on new ideas screams out for change - and that’s where the concept of “personalization” comes in. Personalization is the process of creating unique, customized experiences for customers by adding their own personality traits or preferences to products or services.
There are a number of benefits to personalizing your products and services, from making them more engaging to improving customer satisfaction. But there are also a number of drawbacks, including increased costs and decreased efficiency. So how can you personalize your products and services to create the most efficient and profitable outcomes?

One way is to consider what features your customers would want added to your product or service. This can help you focus on what makes your customers happy, rather than trying to cater too much to everyone.
