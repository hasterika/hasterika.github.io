Types of creativity: What is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creative art is a type of art that involves personal Vince Vaughn moments and doesn't stem from classical sources. While non-creative art often relies on pre-existing images or templates, creative artists often come up with their own ideas and concepts. This type of creativity can be seen in everything from graffiti to photography. There are many different types of creative art, but the most common ones include mural painting, sculpture, music composition, and fine arts.
