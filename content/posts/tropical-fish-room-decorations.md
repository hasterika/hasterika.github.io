Many people believe creativity is a matter of thinking outside the box and coming up with new solutions. However, this definition of creativity may not be accurate in every instance. In fact, creativity may be more accurately defined as the ability to come up with original solutions to problems or challenges.

The Benefits of Big Ideas: Why should we be thinking about big ideas?
Big ideas are the stuff of dreams and innovation. They can be anything from simple, like a new product or service, to groundbreaking, like a new way of thinking about life. And they can be big enough to bring about real change – or simply be interesting enough to inspire others to come up with their own big ideas.
The benefits of big ideas are clear: they drive innovation and creativity, help businesses expand their reach and reach new markets, increase productivity and efficiency, and even improve communication and teamwork. But there are also some key reasons why we should think about big ideas more often – and research has shown that the rewards can be great indeed.

The impact of technology on society: How will the impact of technology change society?
The impact of technology on society has been debated for years, but no definitive answer exists. In 2022, a group of researchers from Northeastern University released a report which suggests that technology will have a major impact on society. The report reflects on the future of technology and how it will affect different aspects of our lives, including work, education, and family life. 
One potential outcome is that more people will be employed through digital means. This could lead to an increase in income and wealth for those who can afford it, as well as fewer jobs available for those who cannot. It is also possible that this trend will lead to an increase in stress levels and tension within families. This could cause problems such as decreased productivity at work or increased absenteeism. 

Another potential outcome is that society may become more democratic.
