Conclusion
Creative Art: The End of an Era?
For years, creative art has been a staple in society. Whether it’s paintings in a museum or music playing on the radio, art is everywhere. However, with the rise of technology and the changing landscape of the world, is creative art becoming a thing of the past?

With more and more people living their lives online, it’s no surprise that the demand for creative art is declining. With so much content available at our fingertips, it’s easy to see why many people are losing interest in buying paintings or going to concerts. With less demand, there’s also less money going into funding creative projects, which means we could see a decline in quality and quantity of art in the future.

That’s not to say that all hope is lost for creative art.
