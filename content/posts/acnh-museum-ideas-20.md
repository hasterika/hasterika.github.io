Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.

Why do you think your ideas are interesting?
Ideas are the fuel that drives creativity. They can be used to come up with new ideas, or to develop an existing idea into something better. There are a few things you need to do in order to make your ideas stand out from the rest:
1. Make sure your ideas are well-conceptualized and engaging. This means having a clear idea of what you want your product or service to do, and making sure it is interesting enough for people to want to try it.

2. Be clear about what your target audience is. If your idea is for a new product, make sure you know who your target market is, and how you plan on reaching them. This will help you focus on the right things when developing your pitch.

3. Use effective marketing techniques to market your idea.
