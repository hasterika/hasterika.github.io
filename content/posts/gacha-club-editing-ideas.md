Conclusion: What are some of the best ways to get started exploring new ideas?
In any given field of study, there are a variety of ways to get started. Here are a few tips for getting started in new ideas: 
-Start with smaller pieces. Start by trying out a couple of different ideas and seeing what pops into your mind. This will give you a base from which to build more complex concepts around. 
-Capture the idea in an easily remembered phrase or image. This will help you retain the memory for as long as possible and will encourage you to come up with other similar ideas. 
-Ask around. Go online, talk to friends, or attend meeting after meeting to see if anyone has any specific ideas about what you‚Äôre looking for. This way, you won‚Äôt have to start from scratch every time you want to think of something new.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways to cook, Tate Modern‚Äôs newest art gallery or a new way of travelling. Here are some of our favourites:
1. A creative way to relax: take a walk in nature. This can involve finding a meadow with plenty of trees, sitting under a tree and taking in the natural sounds.

2. Experiment with different food preferences: try out different recipes or eat something that you‚Äôve never tried before. This will open your eyes to what foods you like and how they taste.

3. Get creative with your time: use up time by doing something creative like painting, drawing or sculpting. This will help you de-stress and get lost in thought for a little bit.

what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.

How creativity is used in the creative process: creative drawings, paintings, poems, etc.
Creativity is a key component of the creative process. By using different creative methods, artists are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that can help them achieve their goals. For example, when creating a painting, a creative artist might use different colors to create a realistic scene. Similarly, when writing poetry, the writer may use alliteration or other forms of poetry to make the words seem more interesting. In both cases, the artist and writer are trying to find ways to express themselves through their art.
