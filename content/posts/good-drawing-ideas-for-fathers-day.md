The power of creativity:
Creativity is an important part of any business. It can help businesses make money, learn new things, create products or services that are unique and better than the competition, and more. However, too much creativity can be dangerous. In some cases, it can be a lead to innovation that can improve the company’s bottom line or even create new opportunities for growth.

To avoid these dangers, businesses need to take steps to limit their creativity and ensure that their ideas are sound before they begin implementation.
