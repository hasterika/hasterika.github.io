Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new, better ways to do something. It can come from ideas, research, and development (R&D), or even from manufacturing or design. Innovation is often different than other types of innovation, such as creativity or efficiency.
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas that are different from what has been done before. It can come from brainstorming and poking around in your own mind, or from talking to others about what they have come up with. Innovation also comes from seeing things in a new way, whether itâ€™s when you come up with a new product idea or when you fix an old one.

What are some of the challenges you face when trying new ideas?
There are a number of challenges that can come about when trying new ideas. Some of these challenges may include: difficulty in getting others to embrace the idea, derailed progress because of creative differences, and confusion over what is truly important when it comes to implementing the idea. However, even if these obstacles don't seem insurmountable, they can still cause setbacks and make it difficult to see the value in pursuing an idea. It's important to remember that ideas are worth pursuing, regardless of the obstacles that may be encountered along the way. So whether you're facing difficulty adapting or disagreement over how best to use an 8-bit game as your business model, remember that ideas are worth fighting for.

Definition of creativity: How does it differ from mere creativity?
Creativity is an important word, but it can also be defined in different ways. In one definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems. This definition is a bit more broad, and does not include things like working on specific projects or creating something out of nothing. In another definition, creativity is the spark that ignites the creative process. This definition includes anything from creating new designs to coming up with new ways to market products. The key difference between these two definitions is how creativity is measured. One example could be when someone defines creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems, but does not measure it against other criteria such as productivity or success. Another example could be measuring creativity by its ability to ignite the creative process.
