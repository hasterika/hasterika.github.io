Ideas for transportation: What can we do to improve transportation?
How can we improve transportation? 
There are many ways to improve transportation, but here are some ideas for transportation that could be implemented in 2022.

1. More public transportation: Government and non-profit organizations should work together to create more public transportation. This would help decrease traffic congestion and provide a more efficient way to get around town.
2. Improved bike infrastructure: Bicycles can play an important role in improving transportation, as they are environmentally friendly and easy to ride. Bike lanes should be built in major cities so people can easily access the rest of the city without having to navigate through traffic. 
3. Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles have many potential benefits for transportation, including reducing pollution and saving money on fuel expenses.

Improvements you can get from a contractor: How can you choose the best option for renovating or upgrading your home?
There are many ways to improve the look of your home without spending a fortune. By following some simple DIY tips, you can make your home more comfortable and stylish. Here are four easy changes that you can make to your home in no time:
1. Add a new coat of paint. This is a relatively simple change that can update your home's appearance for a fraction of the cost of hiring a professional painter. Just select an appropriate color, mix it with some other old pieces in your house, and you're good to go.

2. Replenish the windows and door frames . A fresh coat of paint can brighten up an already aging building by updating the look and function of the glass elements. Not only will this add character to your property, but it can also be helpful in keeping cold weather out while heating up during summer months.
