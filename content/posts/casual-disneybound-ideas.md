Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.

The challenges of reaching our goals: How can we overcome roadblocks?
There are many challenges we face when looking to achieve our goals, but overcoming them is key to success. Here are a few examples:
First and foremost, it is important to have realistic expectations. If we set ourselves unrealistic goals, we will be less likely to achieve them. We should also be honest with ourselves about what we want and what our limitations are. This will help us identify any roadblocks that may stand in our way.

The second challenge is breaking the habit of procrastination. This can be difficult as it is an acquired taste, but having a regular plan and sticking to it will help us stay on track. However, if we don’t have enough motivation or if the situation feels too hard, it can be tough to keep going.

Thirdly, it is important to be consistent with our efforts.
