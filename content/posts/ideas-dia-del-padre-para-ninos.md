History of inventions: How have inventions been made over time?
Inventions have been made for centuries, but it is only recently that there has been a concerted effort to collect and study these inventions. Many of the most amazing and influential inventions have come about through collaboration between multiple individuals or teams. Here are four examples of how inventions have been made over time:

1) The telephone – This invention was first developed in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell and his partner Samuel Morse. They designed a talking telephone which could be used to communicate with one another.

2) The electric light bulb – This invention was first developed in 1879 by George Stephenson and John Wise. They created a device that could be plugged into an electrical outlet and use electricity to produce light.

3) The air-purifier – This invention was first developed in 1919 by Maynard Kelleher and Clifford Berry.
