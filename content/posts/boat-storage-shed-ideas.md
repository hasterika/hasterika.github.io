Definition of creativity: How does it differ from mere creativity?
Creativity is an important word, but it can also be defined in different ways. In one definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems. This definition is a bit more broad, and does not include things like working on specific projects or creating something out of nothing. In another definition, creativity is the spark that ignites the creative process. This definition includes anything from creating new designs to coming up with new ways to market products. The key difference between these two definitions is how creativity is measured. One example could be when someone defines creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems, but does not measure it against other criteria such as productivity or success. Another example could be measuring creativity by its ability to ignite the creative process.
