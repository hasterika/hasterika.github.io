Tools: How should you use the tools you have?
If you have a few tools that you like to use, it's important to know how to use them in order to get the most out of them. Here are four easy ways to use your tools the right way:
1) Make a toolset: When you have a few tools, it's better to make a toolset rather than purchase individual tools. This will save you time and money in the long run. A good starting point is an electronic toolkit, such as this one from Amazon. You can find other options here.

2) Use common sense: It's important not only to be able to use your tools but also be aware of what they do. If something doesn't work or doesn't seem right, try turning it around and using another tool instead.

brainstorming: What is a good way to come up with new invention ideas?
brainstorming is a process of ideas generation in which people gather input and come up with new ways to do things. It can be used for everything from developing new products to coming up with new ways to win contests. There are a number of different brainstorming tools available, but the most popular ones are the group home, online chat, and creative problem-solving tools. 
One way to come up with new invention ideas is to use brainstorming tools as part of a collaborative environment. Groups can work together to come up with solutions to problems or come up with new ideas for products. This can be a great way for groups to get creative and share their ideas. If you don't have any brainstorming tools at home, there are plenty of online resources available that can help you get started.
