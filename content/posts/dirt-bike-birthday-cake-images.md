Origins and definition of art: How does art start?
Creative art is the act or process of creating art through the use of creativity. There are many definition for art, but one that stands out the most is that it starts with the individual’s idea and then grows into something else. For example, a painting may start as an Impressionist sketch and grow into a full-blown painting. The definition changes with every artist, but the idea of creativity remains the same.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.

Brainstorming: What are some brainstorming techniques?
Creative brainstorming techniques are often used to come up with new ideas for businesses, products, or services. There are many different ways to explore and come up with creative ideas, so it's important to find the ones that work best for you. Here are some brainstorming techniques to help you get started:
1. Brainstorm with your team: When brainstorming with your team, try to come up with a group plan and work together to come up with ideas. This will help you stay organized and focused on the same goal.

2. Use questionnaires: questionnaire-based brainstorming is a great way to get started in generating new ideas. You can ask your team members questions about their businesses or products and see what responses give you ideas for new concepts.

Barriers to Innovation
Innovation is key to success in any field, yet it can be difficult to come by. There are a number of barriers that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a lack of knowledge, and a lack of creativity.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. This can include both financial resources and human resources. If you don't have the money to invest in new ideas or the people to execute them, it can be very difficult to bring about change.

Another barrier to innovation is a lack of knowledge. If you're not aware of what's possible or you don't understand how things work, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. This is why education and research are so important for promoting innovation.

Finally, a barrier to innovation can simply be a lack of creativity.

Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or product that has not been thought of before. It is often a result of a creative brainstorming session, but can also be created through the use of technology or an algorithm. Invention is an essential part of civilization, and without it, we would not be able to create new products or ideas.
