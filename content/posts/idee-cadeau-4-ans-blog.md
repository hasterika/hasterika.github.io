The Key: What are the essential steps in the creative process?
Creative ideas are like seeds. They can be sown in any direction, but they will eventually germinate and produce a flower. The key to success when it comes to creative ideas is to have a clear plan for how you want the idea to turn into a reality. Once you have a good Idea, the next step is to come up with specific details that will make it real. You need to know what your target market is, what your competition is, and what your goals are. Once you have all of these details nailed down, it's time to start planning the execution. You'll need to create a timeline, set up funding sources, and get started on developing your idea. If all of this sounds like too much work, don't worry! There are plenty of resources available online that can help you get started on your creative journey.

Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.
