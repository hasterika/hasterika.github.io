What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.

Tips for creating a growth strategy
Are you looking to grow your business? If so, there are a number of ideas to help you reach your goals. Here are a few tips to help you get started: 1. Start by creating a growth strategy- this will outline your goals and objectives for the business, and how you plan on achieving them. It will also include strategies for gaining new customers and growing sales. 2. Use market research- doing surveys, talking to customers, and analysing data can all help you understand what is working in other businesses and adapt it for your own operation. 3. Get involved with online communities- online groups can be great resources for finding advice from others who have gone before, as well as sharing ideas and experiences with other entrepreneurs on the topic of growth.
