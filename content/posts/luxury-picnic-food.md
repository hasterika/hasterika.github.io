Idea generation: What makes some ideas more creative than others?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are more creative than others, but there are some general principles that apply to all creative ideas.
One principle is that ideas should be original. Ideas that are based on other people's work or experience can be less creative because they're recycled or copied from other sources.

Another principle is that ideas should be fresh. Ideas that have been around for a while can become stale and unoriginal. Fresh ideas are always more innovative and exciting to think about.

Tips For Creating More Effective Art: What tips can you give to help improve your artwork?
When it comes to creating effective art, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some tips that may help improve your work: 
1. Start with a good idea. When you have an idea for an artwork, the next step is to develop it into a complete work. This means working on the ideas and concepts behind your piece before starting on the actual painting or sculpture. 

2. Take advantage of constructive criticism. A lot of times it’s helpful to get feedback from other people in order to improve your pieces. It will also give you a better understanding of what worked and what didn’t work in your work overall. 

3. Be persistent. The best way to stay motivated when painting or sculpture is to keep pushing yourself.
