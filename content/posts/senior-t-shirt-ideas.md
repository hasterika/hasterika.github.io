How to Choose the Right Painting Scheme for Your Home
There are a lot of things you can do to “paint” your home, but it’s important to choose the right scheme for your needs. A few key factors to consider include: the size of your home, budgeting restrictions, and the style of your home. If you want an artsy home with lots of details or if you want a sleek, modern look, there are many different painting schemes available. Here are some tips on how to pick the best scheme for your home:
1. Decide how much space you want to dedicate to painting. A small home may not need as much room as a larger one, so decide what scheme will work best for you and your budget.

2. Consider how much light and shadow you want in your paintings. Do you need bright colors in every room?

The Invention of the Electric Shock guitar
Electric shock guitars were invented in the late 1800s by George Lukacs, a musician and inventor. Lukacs had been playing an electric guitar that used alternating current (A.C.) to create sound, and he realized that electric guitars could be used for amplification. In 1892, Lukacs developed his first model electric guitar, the Electric Guitar Company's "Lukacs Guitars." The guitar was designed to be affordable and easy to play, with a single-coil pickup and a simple design. In 1934, Lukacs died at the age of 83, but his electric guitar remains one of the most significant instruments in history.

What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.
