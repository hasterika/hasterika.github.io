The golden rule for getting ideas: You have to be passionate about it
Ideas are a lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we may as well be living in a cave. However, if you're not passionate about your ideas, you'll likely never get very far with them. So how do you get started? The key is to be passionate about your idea and to continue to develop it over time. If you can focus on what you're passionate about and keep pushing yourself, eventually your ideas will improve and you'll be on your way to becoming a great thinker.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be any thing you want them to be. Whether it's coming up with new ways of doing something, or coming up with new ways of thinking about things, there are always some great creative ideas out there. Here are a few examples: 
1. Ideas for using the environment around you to your advantage. When you're outside, try to think of ways to use the environment around you to your advantage. For example, if you're at a park, think of ways to make the park more fun by adding activities such as playgrounds and adventure gardens. 

2. Coming up with new ways of advertising. One way to get people's attention is to come up with new ads that are different from what they've seen before.
