Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

The benefits of creative art: How does creativity benefit us?
Creativity has been shown to be beneficial in many ways, from helping people feel more creative and motivated, to improving our thinking and problem solving skills. However, there are also a number of other benefits that can come from creativity. Here are just a few: 
1. Increased understanding of complex topics. When people are able to understand complex concepts more clearly, they are better able to solve problems and make decisions. This is especially true when it comes to matters of the arts, as understanding how an image or painting is composed can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand. 

2. Increased expression and communication. People who are more creative often have more natural communication abilities than those who aren’t. This is because creativity helps us express ourselves in a way that is both original and interesting.
