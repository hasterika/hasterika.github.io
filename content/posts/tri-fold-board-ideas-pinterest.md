The future of finance: What will new financial technologies mean for society?
There are a number of new financial technologies that could have a dramatic impact on society in the next few years. Here are four examples:
1. Blockchains: Blockchain technology is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. This could mean big changes for the way money is used, especially in the banking and insurance sectors.
