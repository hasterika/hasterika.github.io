Definition of creativity: A discovery or arrival at a new idea, concept, or product
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or products. It can be found in people of all ages and walks of life. Some people are more creative than others, but creativity is something that everyone can have. What makes someone creative? There is no one answer to this question. However, there are some key aspects that make someone creative. First and foremost, creativity comes from experiencing the world in a new way and trying new things. This can be found in people of all ages and walks of life. Another key aspect of creativity is seeing things from a different perspective. The idea of looking at something from a different angle can help you come up with new ideas or products. People who are more creative often have a strong imagination and are able to see things from many different angles. Finally, creativity often comes with effort.
