Creative thinking is a process that starts with the idea and then it's refined into a creation.

What is the new idea?
The new idea is to use a smartwatch as a fitness tracker. People wear trackers all the time, so why not wear one on their wrist? This would be great for people who are already healthy and want to keep track of their fitness and activity levels. Another benefit of this technology is that it could be used as a communication device. You could use it to text or call someone while you are working out, or even while you are lying in bed.

Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.

What can be done to address them?
In recent years, there have been a number of proposals put forth to address the opioid epidemic. Some of these proposals include increasing access to treatment, distributing Narcan kits to civilians in need, and regulating prescription opioids. However, each proposal has its own set of challenges and limitations. Here are four examples:
1) Prescription opioids are highly addictive and can lead to addiction and death if not treated. 
2) The distribution of Narcan kits is difficult and often requires an affiliation with a specialty hospital or ambulance service. 
3) The regulation of prescription opioids is complex and often depends on the669 individual state laws. 
4) Addressing the opioid epidemic will require multiple strategies and interventions that work together.
