Patent applications: How do inventors apply for patents?
Do inventors have to apply for patents? If so, what types of patents do they need?
Inventors need to apply for patents if they want to protect their invention. Patent applications are different depending on the type of patent you want, but typically all inventors need to apply for a utility patent and a design patent. 

 Utility patents are more common and usually last 7 years, while design patents last 10 years.
