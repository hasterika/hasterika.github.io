Conclusion: Invent something today
Invention Ideas: How to Be More Creative and Inventive
When it comes to being creative, there are a few things you can do to help yourself become more inventive. First, take some time to brainstorm. Get a piece of paper and a pen, and start jotting down whatever comes to mind. Don't censor yourself; just let the ideas flow. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. What do they have in common? What are their differences?

Another helpful tip is to try something new. Be open to exploring different activities, hobbies, and interests. This will help broaden your perspective and give you more fodder for your brainstorming sessions. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. The best way to come up with new ideas is to play around with the ones you already have.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.
