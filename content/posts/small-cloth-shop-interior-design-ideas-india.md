What are some good ideas?
1. Get organized: Make a to-do list and keep it with you when you need to focus on a task.
2. Automate your tasks: Use the tools you already have at your disposal like email, desktop calendars, or phone apps to help take care of your work.
3. Be patient: Take your time and ordeal with ideas until you find the perfect one for you.
4. Get organized and motivated: Use positive reinforcement as motivation to stay on track with your ideas.

Category: Creative Ideas
Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.

Creative people are often seen as those who come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. They are also often seen as those who are creative in how they approach their work. This is because creativity is not just about coming up with new ideas; it is also about exploiting the possibilities that ideas offer. Creative people are able to see beyond what others see and understand the potential in things that others might not even consider.
