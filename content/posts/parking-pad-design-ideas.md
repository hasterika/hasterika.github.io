The history of creativity: How has creativity evolved over time?
Creativity has been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that it has become so important in today’s society. In fact, creativity is often seen as one of the most underrated skills, as many people believe that creativity can only come from a certain type of mind. However, according to some researchers, creativity may actually be more common than we thought. In fact, creativity may even be more prevalent than originally thought. For example, research has shown that children as young as 2 years old are already capable of Civil War-era painting and poetry. And while many people believe that creativity comes from a “mental faculty” such as genius or IQ, this is not always the case. In fact, many people report feeling their creative juices flowing at an early age. So what is behind the resurgence of creativity?

Conclusion: Some tips for starting off on a fresh thinking project.
When starting a new project, it can be helpful to have fresh ideas in tow. Here are a few tips to help you get started:
1. Take your time - don't rush the process. This will help you stay organized and focused on what you're working on.

2. Be open to feedback - always work with someone who has an opposing view to get their insights on the project. This will help you figure out where you need clarification and where things could be improved.

3. Break the project down into smaller tasks - this will make it easier to pay attention to each step and make sure that everything is moving along as planned.

4. Don't be afraid of change - change is always a good thing, especially when it comes to projects, since they can often provide new perspectives and opportunities for growth.
