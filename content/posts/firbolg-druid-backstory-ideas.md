Conclusion: We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas.
We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas. If we don't, we're going to get stuck in a rut and never be able to break out of it. There are so many great ideas out there that we just can't put our finger on what to do with them all. So how do we go about finding the ones that will work for us? There are a few things that we can do in order to help ourselves get started: 
1) Take some time for yourself â€“ We all have moments where we feel like we don't have time for anything. But if you take the time to step away from your work or project and relax, you'll usually find yourself with more inspiration than you ever thought possible. It's important to remember that if you're not taking care of yourself, you're going to suffer in the long run.

Definition of creativity: How do you define creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and improved ideas. There are many different ways to define creativity, but one of the most common definitions is that it is a state of being in which one has an innate ability to think outside theordinary. Creativity can be found in everything from design to technology. It can also be found in people who are passionate about their work and those who have a great idea but not enough time or energy to pursue it.
