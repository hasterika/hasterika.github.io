Bringing Your Invention to Market: Tips on how to get your invention into the hands of consumers.
Inventing something is only half the battle. The other half is getting it out there in front of consumers. Here are a few tips on how to get your invention into the hands of people who will use it.
1. Do your research. Make sure your invention is novel and has a marketable purpose. There's no point in trying to sell something that no one wants or needs.

2. Develop a prototype. This will help you to not only test your invention, but also show it to potential manufacturers, retailers, or investors.

3. Get a patent. This will give you legal protection and help you to commercialize your invention by licensing it to others.

4. Market your invention.
