The five types of creativity: Abstract, Imaginative, Creative, Mental, and Physical.
Creative ideas are a type of creativity that comes from different areas of the brain. The five types of creativity are abstract, imaginative, creative, mental, and physical.

Creative ideas come from all different parts of the brain and can be physical or mental. Mental creativity is when you have a strong idea but do not know how to put it into words. Physical creativity comes when you come up with new ways to use old things. Finally, there is creative physicality which comes about when you create something that no one has ever thought of before.
