The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

Conclusion: Some tips for coming up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ideas for products or services. Here are a few tips to help you come up with creative ideas:
1. Brainstorm with others: When brainstorming, it is helpful to take turns sharing your ideas. This will allow you to gain feedback and improve on what you’re thinking.

2. Use analogies and metaphors: Analogies and metaphors are powerful tools for coming up with new ideas. For example, if you’re brainstorming product concepts, you might compare a toy to a Ferrari or a computer game to the cockpit of an airplane.

3. Take advantage of opportunity: Opportunity is the key to creativity, and taking advantage of it will help you come up with more creative solutions than you would have otherwise thought possible.

Types of creativity: Realistic, abstract, etc.
Creativity is a difficult thing to define. Some people might say that creativity is ideas that come out of the blue, while others might say that creativity is being able to come up with new and exciting ways to do something. To some, it may be easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not have a specific definition for what creative art really is. However, regardless of what someone believes or how they define it, there are definitely types of creativity that are more realistic than abstract and more realistic than creative art.
