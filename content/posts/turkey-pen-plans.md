Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from traditional methods of production and consumption?
Innovations, according to most definitions, are changes in the way things are done that make them more efficient or effective. However, innovation can also refer to different methods of production and consumption â€“ changes in how we produce and consume goods and services.
Traditional methods of production and consumption have been around for centuries, but they have certain limitations. For example, traditional farming practices require a lot of manual labor to produce goods and services. This means that people who work on traditional farms generally do not have access to high-quality products or services.

On the other hand, new technologies and innovations can allow people to produce goods and services without any human involvement. For example, computer-generated images (CGIs) can be used to create realistic 3D images that are then used by companies to sell products.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a powerful tool for improving business efficiency, creativity, and overall productivity. By having more ideas, businesses can move faster and make better decisions when it comes to product innovation, marketing campaigns, and even store design. In fact, the more ideas a business has, the harder it is to stay ahead of the competition. Here are four reasons why you should start taking advantage of all those innovative juices:
1. More Ideas Means Faster Product Development: When a business has more ideas on its plate, they're more likely to come up with better products that meet customer needs. Not only do they have more options to consider when coming up with new products, but they also have time to test different concepts and see which ones work best before moving forward with an actual product.
