The 4 Cs of Creative Work: What are some factors to consider when coming up with ideas?
Creative work is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. Sometimes, the best way to do this is through brainstorming sessions or informal discussions with friends or colleagues. But what are some factors to consider when coming up with creative ideas? Here are four key ones:
1. Category: What is your idea in question? This will determine its feasibility and whether it can be turned into a successful product or service.
2. Concept: How well does your idea align with the category you have chosen? If it's a new take on an old product, for example, then you'll need to come up with a concept that makes sense within the category being explored. And if your idea isn't aligned in any way, it might not be worth pursuing at all.
3. Target Market: Who can actually use your idea?
