Inspiration: How does one getInspiration for their work?
Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project: 
1) Take breaks throughout the day: A break can help you re-evaluate what you're working on and whether it's something that's inspiring or not. Sometimes taking a step back will give you new perspective that'll spark new ideas. 
2) Be open to suggestions: If you don't have any ideas of your own, sometimes talking with other creatives or reading articles or watching videos will help you develop new ideas.

Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.

The different types of Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is a process of creating a new product or service from scratch. There are many different types of inventions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Below are three examples of invention:
1) A new type of transportation: A car is an invention, because it has been around for centuries. 
2) A new type of food: We have invented grains and potatoes, so there is no one food that can be called "rice" or "potatoes." 
3) A new way to grow plants: We've invented peas and carrots, so there's no need for planting seeds in the ground all year round.

Brainstorming Tips: How do you best use brainstorming to come up with new ideas?
brainstorming is an effective tool for coming up with new ideas. However, there are a few things you can do to make the process more efficient and effective. First, try to group your ideas together so that they are easier to understand. Additionally, use active listening techniques to help you hear and understand what your potential clients or customers are saying. Finally, be sure to keep track of what you come up with during brainstorming so that you can later refer back to it and develop new ideas based on what you heard.
