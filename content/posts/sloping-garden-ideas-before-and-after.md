Winter weather: Tips to keep your home warm
If you're like most people, you probably think of winter as the time when your house is cold and unused. But that's not always the case. In fact, there are a few things you can do to keep your home warm during the winter. Here are some tips:
1) Keep your windows open at all times. This will let in natural sunlight, which will help keep your home warm.
2) Use a fireplace or heat pad. Fires add warmth to any space, and they also emit noxious gases which can help block out wind noise and cold air from coming in.
3) Place an electric blanket over every piece of furniture in your room. This will place an electric field between yourself and the elements, which will help keep you warm (or cooler) during the winter months.
