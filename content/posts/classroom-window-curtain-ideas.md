The challenges of invention: Describe some of the challenges faced by inventors.
Invention is often lauded as the key to progress. Indeed, many of the most important advances in human history have come about through invention. But what is often overlooked is the fact that invention can be a difficult and challenging process. Inventors must not only be creative, but they must also have the persistence and determination to see their ideas through to fruition.
The challenges of invention are many and varied. Inventors must first come up with an idea that is both novel and useful.

Even after an invention is completed, there are still challenges to be faced, such as marketing the invention and ensuring that it meets all safety and regulatory requirements.

Generating ideas can be a daunting task, whether you’re starting a new project or looking for ways to improve an existing one. But with a little creativity and some structure, the process can be much less intimidating.
