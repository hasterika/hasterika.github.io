The power of creativity: How can creativity help you achieve success?
Creativity is a necessary part of any successful business. Whether itâ€™s coming up with new ideas for products or services, or coming up with new ways to reach your target market, creativity is essential to success. But what exactly is creativity? And how can it help you achieve success?
Creativity comes from the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts. It can be used to come up with fresh ways to approach problems, or to come up with new solutions to problems. It can also be used in order to improve productivity, or in order to increase sales.

But the most important thing about creativity is that it should be used in a positive way. It should not just be used as an outlet for negative emotions, but rather it should be used in order to help you achieve success.

Creative artists: How many there are and what makes them special?
Creative artists are an often overlooked but important part of the art world. They come from many different backgrounds and have a range of different skills and techniques. Some are able to use their creative abilities to create beautiful or powerful artwork, while others specialize in specific genres or styles. However, all artists have something special that sets them apart from other artists. Here are four examples: 
Allison Bechdel is a well-known cartoonist who specializes in creation of humorous strips about female characters, which has made her one of the most recognizable and popular comic book authors of all time; performance artist Grant Wood created memorable posters and paintings during the Depression era that stand as benchmarks for American artistry; and David Stone Martin is known for his dramatic story-telling with his unique use of sound and light.
