Creativity in the arts: Some key aspects to consider.
Creativity in the arts goes beyond the creation of artworks or sculptures. It can also be found in the use of ideas and concepts, as well as working with others to create something beautiful. Whether it’s a hobby or a profession, creativity is important to have at any stage of life. Here are some key aspects to consider when trying to achieve creativity: 
1) Be open-minded: One of the most important things to remember when trying to be creative is that no two things are ever alike. As such, you must be willing to try new things and explore different fields of thought. However, don’t forget that creativity comes from within – so if you can remain patient and allow your thoughts and ideas to grow, you will eventually find an avocado on the grocery store shelf that matches your design inspiration!

What obstacles do they present?
A new approach to energy storage is being developed with the goal of overcoming some of the major obstacles to its widespread implementation. One obstacle is the need for large, expensive batteries that can be used in stationary or home applications. Another obstacle is the difficulty in fabricating lithium-ion cells that can withstand repeated charges and discharge cycles. However, a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University has created a new battery design that overcome both challenges and could soon be available for use in devices such as cell phones and electric vehicles. The new battery uses nickel-cadmium (NMC) cells instead of lithium ion cells to store energy, which makes it more environmentally friendly and cheaper to produce. The team's findings are published in an upcoming issue of Science Advances.
