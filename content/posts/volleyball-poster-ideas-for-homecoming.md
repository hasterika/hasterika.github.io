Definition of innovation: The process of making something new and improved

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.

Tips for using creative ideas: How can you use your creativity to your advantage?
Creative ideas are a great way to come up with new and innovative ways to solve problems or create new products. However, there are a few things you can do to make sure that your creative ideas are successful:
1) Make sure that your ideas are original. Don’t steal other people’s ideas, or use old ideas without giving them a fresh start.
2) Use your imagination. When you come up with creative ideas, don’t just think about what might work – try out different scenarios and see what comes up.
3) Get feedback from others. Take the time to ask people who have experience with the product or problem you’re thinking of solving how they would approach it. This will help you develop your idea into something that is both effective and appealing to potential customers.
