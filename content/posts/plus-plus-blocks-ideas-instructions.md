Creative processes: How do you go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come in any form, whether it’s coming up with a new product, idea for a new show, or even just a new way to look at something. Whether you want to come up with something original or simply reuse an existing idea, there are some key processes that you need to follow when coming up with creative ideas. 
The first step is to think about what you want your product or show to be. Once you have this idea in mind, it’s important to brainstorm different ways that you can make it happen. This could mean looking at different concepts and seeing which ones appeal to you the most, or exploring other possibilities and seeing which ones work best for your project.
