Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them.

creating a plan: What steps should you take to create a plan for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that you want them to be, but there are a few key steps you should take in order to create a plan for your creative ideas. First, identify what kind of ideas you want to pursue. Once you have a solid idea of what you want to create, it’s time to start thinking about how you will go about pursuing those ideas. 
Next, think about the resources you will need in order to pursue your creative ideas. What tools and equipment do you need in order to begin working on your projects? If you don’t have any tools or equipment, it’s important to find someone who does and ask them for help. Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to start thinking about the deadline that you will be wanting your project done by.

what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of introducing something new into the market. This can be a new product, a new service, or a new way of doing things. Innovation is about taking risks and making changes in order to improve the way we do things.
