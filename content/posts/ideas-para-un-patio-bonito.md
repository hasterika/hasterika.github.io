Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers. 

Once an idea has been created, it is important to find someone who can test and market the product. This person can help identify any potential consumer problems and potentially create marketing materials that could be helpful in building sales.

The Pros and Cons: How do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?
There are a lot of new ideas out there. Do you know what they all are? Let's take a look. 
One idea is to use technology to help improve education. Another is to create a more sustainable way of living. Plus, there are many more that have not been mentioned yet. So, how do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?

One thing that is different about the new ideas is that they often focus on solving problems instead of creating them. This makes them better at solving problems that have already been solved before, rather than creating new ones from scratch. 

Another difference between the new ideas and what has been done before is that some of the old solutions may not be as effective anymore or may not work as well anymore in the modern world.
