The history and definition of creative art: From the ancient Greeks to the 20th century
There is no one definition of creative art that can encompass everything that may be considered creative. However, the term “creative” has been used to refer to various activities throughout history. From ancient Greeks to the 20th century, there have been many different definitions of what creativity means. However, one common definition of creativity is “the ability to produce something new and original.” This definition encompasses a wide range of activities, from creating works of art to coming up with new ideas for products or services.
One example of creativity in the ancient Greeks was the use of artistic creation in order to communicate messages. The artist was often used as a medium for discussing important concepts such as justice and morality. The Ancient Greeks also believed that music and dance could be used as forms of creativity in order to express themselves.
