How to make Your Home More Affordable: What are some tips for this?
Many people look for ways to make their home more affordable, but not everyone knows where to start. Here are a few tips to get started:
Start by researching your area and looking for options that fit your budget. You can also ask friends and family if they know of any deals or programs that can help you save money on your home.

Be creative and find ways to make your home more cost-effective. There are plenty of ideas out there, so take the time to explore them all! A good example would be adding an addition or two to your home that can be used as a storage space or bedroom. This will free up some room in the house and allow you to save even more money on your mortgage.

Be consistent with your saves and don’t let yourself become discouraged when it comes time to file for a new mortgage.

What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.
