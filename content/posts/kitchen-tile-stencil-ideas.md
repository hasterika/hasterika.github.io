Idea 1: Share your life story
If you've been married for 10 years, or longer, you know that sharing your life story is a tradition. It's a way to show people that you're committed to them and appreciate them. But what if sharing your life story doesn't feel like it's important to you? What if it feels like a chore?
That's where ideas come in. In order to feel more fulfilled in our lives, we need to focus on what truly matters. So why not share your life story with someone who mattersthrough those experiences? Why not tell them everything about your marital status, your job history, and all of the little things that make up your day-to-day?

It'll give them a currency of understanding and appreciation. Plus, they might be inspired by how much you appreciate them themselves... which is always an added bonus!
