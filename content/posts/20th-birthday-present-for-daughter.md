Idea #2: Get inspiration from other cultures or websites
Inspiration can be found in many places, including websites and cultures. If you are looking to get your ideas for new designs or products from other sources, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, take into account the tone of the website or culture you are looking to emulate. If it is lighthearted and fun, then copying that style will likely be successful. However, if the website or culture is moreserious or educational, then it is important to think about what type of ideas could be included on the site or product. Additionally, think about what type of message the site or culture wants to send. If you want to copy their style but add your own unique spin on it, make sure to do so in a way that is enticing and relevant to the target audience. Finally, always remember that inspiration comes from everywhere and not just from specific websites or cultures.

How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?
