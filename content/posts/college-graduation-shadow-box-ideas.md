Innovation is about taking risks and looking for potential solutions to problems. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of how we interact with the world to the largest ideas in business.

What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.

The power of creativity:
Creativity is an important part of any business. It can help businesses make money, learn new things, create products or services that are unique and better than the competition, and more. However, too much creativity can be dangerous. In some cases, it can be a lead to innovation that can improve the company’s bottom line or even create new opportunities for growth. In other cases, it can lead to over-zealous ideas and a lack of critical thinking skills. To avoid these dangers, businesses need to take steps to limit their creativity and ensure that their ideas are sound before they begin implementation.
