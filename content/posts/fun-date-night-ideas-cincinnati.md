Developing Ideas: How to take a good idea and make it great.
When it comes to developing ideas, the key is to start with a good foundation and then build upon it. Here are some tips on how to take a good idea and make it great:
1. Do your research. Make sure you have a solid understanding of the topic or issue you're trying to address. This will help you create a more well-rounded and thought-out solution.

2. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating with others can help you generate new ideas and perspectives that you may not have considered on your own.

4. Take your time. Don't rush the process of developing your idea.

Causes of change in the economy and society: Innovation leads to change.
Innovation is always a driving force for change in the economy and society. There are many reasons why innovation can lead to changes in behavior, products, services, and even entire industries. 
Some of the primary reasons for innovation are to help businesses succeed more efficiently and faster; to create new consumer demand; to increase production; and to improve efficiency. 

But there are other factors as well, such as the need for new ideas or approaches when it comes to solving problems or meeting needs. When these come together, they can result in radical change in an industry or society.

For example, Google was founded on the idea of bringing search results from different sources together so people could find what they were looking for quickly and easily. This led them to develop a variety of search engines that continues to be a mainstay on the internet today.
