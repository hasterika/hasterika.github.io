The creative process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come from a variety of places within the individual. They can come from inspirations, ideas stemming from one's own life experiences, or even just things that strike the individual as fun or interesting. 
There are a few key things that go into creating creative ideas. The first is to have some sort of starting point. This can be anything from an idea for a project to inspiration for your next painting or poem. Once you've got your idea down, it's important to further refine it and create something tangible out of it. 

Once you've created something that you're happy with, it's time to start working on turning it into a reality. This involves coming up with ways that you can make your idea more effective and efficient in terms of execution.

Invention: The impact of invention on the economy
Invention has a profound impact on the economy. It could be said that without invention, there would be no modern day economy. Invention is the result of creativity and hard work, and it can have a significant impact on business and society. There are many different types of invention, but some of the most common are motorcycles, cars, laptops, and artificial intelligence. Each type of invention has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. For example, motorcycles are great for transportation because they're fast and easy to ride. However, they're not very good at getting people around in city streets or highways. Car manufacturers have been able to create more efficient cars by adding features such as automatic braking and air conditioning. This makes them much easier to use than other vehicles, but they also tend to be more expensive than others.
