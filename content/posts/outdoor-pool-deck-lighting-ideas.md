How to come up with big ideas
If you're looking for big ideas, the best way to come up with them is by brainstorming. It's an effective way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ways to think about problems or possibilities. If you're not sure how to do this, here are some tips:
1. Start by thinking about what you know. What are some of the things that have bedeviled you in the past? What have been some of your biggest challenges? Once you've gathered these information, it's time to start brainstorming potential solutions.

2. Be open-minded. Don't be afraid to change your mind if something comes up during your brainstorming session. After all, creativity is a risky business - it might be fun or it might not work - so don't be afraid to experiment!

The Impacts of Invention: How does innovation impact society as a whole?
Inventions have been a part of society for centuries, but the impact of innovation has only grown in recent decades. Innovation has the ability to change the way we live and work, as well as the ways we view the world around us. The benefits of innovation are vast, and it has had a positive impact on economies, society, and environment. However, there are some challenges that need to be considered before continuing to see such positive impacts. One key challenge is that innovation can often lead to new technologies that can be dangerous or harmful if not used responsibly. Another challenge is that innovation often depends on someone else’s idea or idea being implemented first, which can lead to competition andefficiency in some industries. Overall, these challenges underscore the importance of ensuring that all who benefit from innovation are taken care of when it comes time for new products or services to be created.
