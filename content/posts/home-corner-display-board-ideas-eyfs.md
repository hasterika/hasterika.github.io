Types of creativity: The five types of creativity.
Creativity is an important factor in any business. Whether it’s a creative idea for a new product, or taking on a new challenge, creativity can help businesses succeed. Here are five different types of creativity that can help your business thrive: 
1. Idea generation: This type of creativity comes from having a creative thought and then coming up with an idea for a product or service. It can be helpful to come up with ideas for products that have never been created before, or products that are different from what is currently being sold. 
2. Innovation: This type of creativity comes from taking on a new challenge and seeing how you can improve upon what has been done before. It can be helpful to come up with ideas for products that are different in terms of design, structure, or function.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
