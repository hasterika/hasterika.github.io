Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The worldâ€™s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.
