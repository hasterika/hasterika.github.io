Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.

Conclusion: Tips for beekeeping and business success with brainstroming
Are you looking to be a successful beekeeper? If so, there are some key things you can do to help. One important thing to keep in mind is that brainstroming is one of the most successful business strategies around. Here are five tips for becoming a more successful beekeeper:

1. Take your time with each hive
Bees aren't constantly on the move, so it takes time to get their colonies up and running. Don't try to rush things - take your time and make sure everything is checked and balanced before starting hives again. This will help ensure that the colony is healthy and thriving.
2. Know your colonies' needs
When you're setting up your hive, it's important to know what the colony's needs are. Knowing what food they need, water requirements, space needed, etc.
