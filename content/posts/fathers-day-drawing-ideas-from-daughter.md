In some cases, this can be an extended period of time - for example, if someone has been thinking about the same subject constantly for a few days or weeks.

The Evolution of Invention: From the Ancient Greeks to the Modern World
Invention is the process by which humans come up with new ideas, products, or methods. Innovation has been a part of human culture for as long as humans have been able to create things. The ancient Greeks were some of the first to come up with inventions. They had a system in which they would submit new ideas to a panel of judges, and if they were found to be good, they would be printed out and given to other people. The judges would then use their judgement to decide who should get the idea and who should make it into a product.
The modern world is full of invention. We have technology that allows us to create anything we want, and we can also find ways to improve on what others have created before us. This makes innovation something very important for humanity.
