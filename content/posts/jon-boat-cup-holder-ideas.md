Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach?

Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future?

Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?
