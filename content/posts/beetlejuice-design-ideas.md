The history of invention ideas: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention ideas have changed over time, and as a result, the history of Invention Ideas is reflective of that. One way invention ideas have changed is in how they are created.  In the past, invention ideas were often based on scientific understanding at the time they were conceived. However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham.
