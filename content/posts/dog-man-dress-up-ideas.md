What are some common mistakes people make when starting a blog?
There are a few common mistakes people make when starting a blog, and the most important thing is to be aware of them so that you don’t make them. Here are some mistakes to watch out for:
1. Not knowing what you want your blog to say. When you first set up your blog, it might seem like a great idea to just post whatever is on your mind. But if you don’t really know what you want your blog to achieve, then it will likely fail. So start by planning out what your goals are and focus on hitting those goals rather than just posting anything without knowing why or how it will help you achieve those goals.

2. Not having a clear strategy for growth. One of the best ways to ensure that your blog does well is to have a solid strategy for growing it over time.
