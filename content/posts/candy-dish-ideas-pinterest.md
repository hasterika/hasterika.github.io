Basic Tips for Doing a Better Job: Be sure to follow these Basic Tips before starting any DIY project, and you'll get the job done right.
If you're looking to improve your DIY skills, there are a few things you should keep in mind before beginning any project. Here are some basic tips to help you get started: 
1) Follow the instructions thoroughly - if something isn't working correctly, take it to someone who knows more about it than you do. This will help prevent any surprises down the line and make sure your project is completed on time and without incident. 

2) Have a plan - once you've got the basics down, it's important to create a plan for how you'll go about completing your project. This will help ensure that everything goes as planned and that nothing gets lost in the process.

The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.
