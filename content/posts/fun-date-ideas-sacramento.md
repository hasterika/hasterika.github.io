gap between theory and practice in innovation: Innovation always involves a change in perspective
The gap between theory and practice in innovation can often be a major obstacle to successful innovation. This problem is compounded by the fact that different fields of study have different methodologyologies and approaches to innovation. This lack of consistency is often the cause of failure when it comes to new product conception or business models. To break through this barrier, researchers typically adopt a methodological perspective, which takes into account the current state of knowledge in their field. In addition, practitioners need to adopt an innovative mindset, which means constantly seeking new ways to improve old products and services. The two sides of the innovation equation need to come together for a better understanding of how the product should be designed, what kind of customer service should be offered, and how much impact new ideas will have on older ones.
