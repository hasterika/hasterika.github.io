Creative expression: What are the different forms of creative expression?

There are many different forms of creative expression and each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few examples:

The artist was often used as a medium for discussing important concepts such as justice and morality. The Ancient Greeks also believed that music and dance could be used as forms of creativity in order to express themselves.
