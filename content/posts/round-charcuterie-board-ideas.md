Inventions are a part of everyday life and they can help people do things they never thought possible. Sometimes, the idea for an invention comes to someone while they are working on something else and then the two ideas mix together. In other cases, someone has an idea and then another person helps them come up with a better idea. Invention ideas can be anything from a new way to make a product to a new way to train people.
