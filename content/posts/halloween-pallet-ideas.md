Definition of Innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods?
There are a few key distinctions between innovation and traditional methods when it comes to how it is defined. Innovation typically refers to new or different ways of doing something, while traditional methods usually refer to older, more common ways of doing things. Some other key differences include that innovation often involves trying different things out and seeing what works, while traditional methods often rely on certainties and expectations which can often lead to disappointment. Despite these differences, however, both types of innovation can have important implications for businesses and society as a whole.
