Group brainstorming
Group brainstorming can be a powerful tool for coming up with invention ideas. By pooling the creative resources of a group of people, you can come up with ideas that you might never have thought of on your own.
To get the most out of group brainstorming, it's important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means establishing ground rules that allow for open and honest discussion without judgement. Once you've established this safe space, encourage everyone to share their ideas freely. The more diverse the perspectives in the group, the better!

With a little creativity and some outside-the-box thinking, group brainstorming can be a great way to generate new invention ideas.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of making a new and improved product or service. Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means coming up with a new idea, developing a better product, or creating a new market niche. Innovation can also be seen as an indicator of success in a business. For example, Google was first to bring the internet to the masses in 1996 and Amazon has been selling books online for centuries. Despite these long histories, both entities have faced many challenges and have eventually become world-renowned companies.

The role of innovation in business: What are some applications of innovation?
Innovation is a term that is often used in business to describe new ideas or methods that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a business. This can be achieved through technological innovations, business model changes, or even product design changes. In recent years, innovation has become more important in businesses as it has become more difficult for companies to stay afloat with traditional methods such as investment and marketing. One way that businesses can use innovation to their advantage is by using it to improve customer service. By taking advantage of new technologies and developing processes that are less time-consuming, businesses can save time and money on customer service. Additionally, by using innovative marketing strategies, businesses can reach a wider audience and increase sales. The role of innovation in business is constantly changing and depends on the specific needs of the business. However, some applications of innovation are always beneficial for businesses.
