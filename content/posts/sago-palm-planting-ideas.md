Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

Why and how do people come up with new invention ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, both within and outside of the inventor themselves. Sometimes, an idea is sparked by something that the inventor sees or hears. Other times, someone else has an idea that the inventor thinks could be improved. In either case, it is important to find out why the inventor came up with the idea in the first place and how they went about making it a reality.
