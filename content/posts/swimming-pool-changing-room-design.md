4th idea:
There are a lot of ideas out there. How do you know which ones are worth pursuing? And how do you come up with new ideas in the first place?
Here are four ways to come up with better ideas:

1. Be open to new experiences

If you want to have more and better ideas, you need to be open to new experiences. That means trying new things, meeting new people, and exposing yourself to new ideas. The more experiences you have, the more material you have to work with when it comes time to generate new ideas.

2. Be persistent

Coming up with good ideas is hard work. Don't expect to have a great idea every time you sit down to brainstorm. It takes time, effort, and a lot of trial and error. The key is to keep at it until you find that one winning idea.
