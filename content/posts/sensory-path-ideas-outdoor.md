How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. Without them, startups would eventually die or be forced to change their business model in order to make room for an original solution. There are a variety of ways to generate ideas, but the most common approach is to come up with a problem that you can solve. This can be done through brainstorming, tinkering, or even taking on a challenge from someone else. The next step is to come up with possible solutions to the problem.
