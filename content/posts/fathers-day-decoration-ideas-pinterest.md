Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:
1) The first electronic device was created in 1861 by George Stephenson and James Clerk Maxwell. This was known as the Manchester Electrician's Watch. It was used to tell time and helped people stay healthy during health epidemics like bubonic plague.

2) Invention of combustion engine in 1879 by John Fenton and Arthur Couch. This allowed cars to be driven on paved roads instead of being pulled by horses or carts.

What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.
