The creative process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come from a variety of places within the individual. They can come from inspirations, ideas stemming from one's own life experiences, or even just things that strike the individual as fun or interesting. 
There are a few key things that go into creating creative ideas. The first is to have some sort of starting point. This can be anything from an idea for a project to inspiration for your next painting or poem. Once you've got your idea down, it's important to further refine it and create something tangible out of it. 

Once you've created something that you're happy with, it's time to start working on turning it into a reality. This involves coming up with ways that you can make your idea more effective and efficient in terms of execution.
