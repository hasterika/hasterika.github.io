Exercise: How to be creative in your everyday life
Creativity is a key word in everyone’s vocabulary. Whether you are a creative artist, graphic designer, or just someone who enjoys making things, creativity is important to have in your everyday life.

2. Use your imagination: The more fun you can have when thinking about ideas, the more likely you will be to come up with new ones.
