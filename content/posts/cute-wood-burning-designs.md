The history of invention ideas: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention ideas have changed over time, and as a result, the history of Invention Ideas is reflective of that. One way invention ideas have changed is in how they are created.  In the past, invention ideas were often based on scientific understanding at the time they were conceived. However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham. The telephone was originally designed to be a basic communication resource for soldiers in war-time. However, after seeing how useful cellular phones could be for civilians, Armstrong and Stratham decided to create a product that could be used by everyone including business people and everyday citizens.

Results and Feedback: How does your project turn out?
I’m about to head out on a camping trip with my family, and I wanted to know what type of tents and sleeping bags are the best for the trip. I found a few different options, but couldn’t decide which one would be best for us. After some research, I came up with this list of the best tents and sleeping bags for camping trips:
1) national Geographic Hexagon Sleeping Bag - This bag is perfect if you're looking for a comfortable and spacious tent. It has an interior profile that makes it easy to find a place to sleep while on your trip. Plus, it comes in black or green!

2) Osprey Tents - These tents are perfect if you're looking for a heavyweight tent that can withstand any weather conditions. They come in both children's and adult sizes and have plenty of hanging space inside.
