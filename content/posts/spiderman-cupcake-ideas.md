Creative ideas can be a great way to focus and get your creative juices flowing. However, there are a few best practices to follow if you want to create truly unique and amazing ideas. Here are three tips: 1) Make sure your idea is well-founded – before you start brainstorming, make sure that your idea has some basis in reality. This will help you come up with more innovative solutions and make your project more credible. 2) Find somebody who can help – If you’re going to have any hope of coming up with great ideas, it’s helpful to have someone else on board who can provide guidance and feedback.
