The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.

Tips for Building a Better Home: How can you go about doing this?
One way to improve your home is by taking on some DIY projects. There are a variety of ways to go about this, so it really comes down to what you're interested in and what's available to you. Here are some tips for improving your home: 
2) Check out home improvement stores before starting any project. Not all stores carry the same tools and supplies, so you'll need to do some research before beginning any project. Look for stores that specialize in particular types of repairs or enhancements, like ad-hoc woodworking or electrical work. 
3) Get a good localpenter if you can't find the supplies or know someone who can help you out. A good localpenter will be able to help with everything from fixing dents in walls to installing new flooring or window trimming.
