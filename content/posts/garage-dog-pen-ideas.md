Conclusion: Invention ideas are a great way to get your idea out there and see what people think of it.
As a business owner, inventor, or just someone who loves to see their ideas come to life, it can be really exciting to see what other people think of your invention. It can also help get your idea out there and see how people are reacting to it. So many times, the less you know about your invention before you make it public, the more risky it is to try and market it yourself. But with the right invention ideas, you can take advantage of all the publicity that comes with them and make sure your idea is seen by as many people as possible.

Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!
