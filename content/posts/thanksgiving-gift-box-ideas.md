Why we need big ideas
In a world that is constantly moving and changing, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas are what drive progress and keep us moving forward. They inspire us to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems that we never thought possible.
Without big ideas, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things over and over again. It is big ideas that push us to do better and be better. They challenge us to think differently and see the world in new ways.

So why do we need big ideas? Because they are what make the world go round. They are what keep us moving forward and progressing as a society. With out them, we would be lost.

Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.
