How to start a small business
Starting a small business can be a daunting task, but there are a few key steps that you can take to make it easier. Here are some tips to get started:
1. think about your target market. What is your main focus? Are you selling products or services? Do you have an existing customer base? If not, what do you need to do to reach them?

2. research your competition. Do you have any competitors in your industry that you could study and contrast yourself against? This will help provide direction for your business idea.

3. create a plan of attack. How will you market and sell your product or service? How will you generate revenue? What type of marketing strategy will work best for YOU and YOUR business? This information should be included in the business plan (or indeed, anywhere else related to starting a small business).
