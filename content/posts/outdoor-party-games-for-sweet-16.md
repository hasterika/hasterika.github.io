What are some common ways to get started with ideas?
Ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: they're always ready to be used. Whether you're looking to start a new project, brainstorm for a new business idea, or just get your creative juices flowing, ideas are a essential part of any creative process. Here are five ways to get started with ideas: 
1. Take some time to think about what you want your business to be. This can be done by brainstorming different concepts or by taking a look at what others have done and figuring out how you could improve on it. 
2. Get organized. Once you've decided on the idea, it's time to start thinking about what kind of organization would work best for it. This can involve creating an outline or organizing everything by genre or need. 
3. Take some notes.

How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.
