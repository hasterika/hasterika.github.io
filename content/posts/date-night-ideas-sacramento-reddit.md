Conclusion: What are some of the best ways to get started exploring new ideas?
In any given field of study, there are a variety of ways to get started. Here are a few tips for getting started in new ideas: 
-Start with smaller pieces. Start by trying out a couple of different ideas and seeing what pops into your mind. This will give you a base from which to build more complex concepts around. 
-Capture the idea in an easily remembered phrase or image. This will help you retain the memory for as long as possible and will encourage you to come up with other similar ideas. 
-Ask around. Go online, talk to friends, or attend meeting after meeting to see if anyone has any specific ideas about what you’re looking for. This way, you won’t have to start from scratch every time you want to think of something new.

The Power of Ideas: Why having a good idea is important.
There's no doubt that having a good idea is important. Ideas are the lifeblood of any business or organisation - without them, you simply wouldn't have anything to offer customers or clients. But what makes a good idea? And how can you make sure that your ideas are as strong as they can be?
A good idea needs to be original and relevant to your target audience. It should also be something that you're passionate about, as this will help you to sell it and get others on board with it. Finally, it's worth considering whether your idea is feasible and practical - if it's not, then it might not be worth pursuing.

If you've got a great idea, then don't be afraid to share it with others.
