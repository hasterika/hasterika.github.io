Implementation: How do you go about using new ideas to improve your business or organization?
When it comes to implementing new ideas, creativity is key. This is why businesses and organizations should take the time to brainstorm what they would like to accomplish with their new initiatives. After all, if a business does not have any clear goals or objectives, it will be difficult to put together a successful plan of action.
One way to come up with specific goals and objectives for your new initiative is by using a brainstorming tool. The most popular option for this is called Scrum, which stands for “Scenario Planning and Reworking in Construction”. This tool allows businesses and organizations to come up with specific goals that need to be accomplished in order for them to meet a certain deadline.

Another great way to come up with specific goals is by using SWOT analysis.

Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.

Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.
