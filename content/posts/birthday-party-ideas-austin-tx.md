Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.

The relationship between creativity and success: What are the implications for us?
Creativity and success are often said to go together like a fine wine and cheese. But what does that actually mean for artists? What are the implications for us? And how do we create the creative work that leads to success?
The answer to all of these questions is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer, but the key is to combine creativity with discipline, practice, and hard work. In order to be successful as an artist, you need to have a strong mix of both talent and effort.

But what does this mean for us as artists? It means that if you want to be successful as an artist, you need to find ways to combine your creativity with your discipline. This can involve finding new ways to approach your work, learning new techniques, and practicing at least twice a day – no matter what your current level of creativity is.
