Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.

The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.
