The four types of creativity
Creativity is a complex and multi-layered concept that can be broken down into four main categories: visual, auditory, nonverbal, and cognitive. Each type of creativity has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Visual creativity is largely based on the ability to see things in a different way. This can be done through creative thought or observation, or by using one's imagination. Visual artists often use color to create unique designs or patterns.

Audio creativity involves creating sounds that are unique and appealing. This can be done through vocals, keyboards, guitars, or drums. Audio artists often use sound effects or rhythms to add interest and excitement to their work.

Nonverbal creativity occurs when people communicate their ideas through body language and facial expressions. Nonverbal artists often use eye contact, gestures, and vocal techniques to express their ideas.

what is creative art?
Creative art is a type of art that is open to interpretation. It can be anything from painting and sculpture, to music and dance. Creative art is about expressing yourself and your ideas, in a way that is unique to you.
There are no rules or guidelines to creative art, which is what makes it so special. It is a way for you to express yourself freely, without having to conform to anyone else’s standards.

Creative art can be a great outlet for emotions and feelings that you may not be able to express in words. It can be therapeutic, and help you to connect with your inner thoughts and feelings.
