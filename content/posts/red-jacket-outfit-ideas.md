How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.

Conclusion: Creative Thinking Tips for You
Creative thinking can help you come up with unique and innovative ideas. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Keep your ideas open-ended – don’t have everything mapped out in your head before you start brainstorming. Be flexible and allow yourself to change and evolve your ideas as you think of more.

2. If you want to be really successful at creative thinking, keep things simple and achievable. Try not to overthink things or try to come up with too many solutions at once – just focus on the problem at hand and see where it leads.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment – there is no limit to what you can achieve when you take risks and try new methods.
