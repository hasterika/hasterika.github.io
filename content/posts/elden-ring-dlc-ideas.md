The impact of technology on society: How will the impact of technology change society?
The impact of technology on society has been debated for years, but no definitive answer exists. In 2022, a group of researchers from Northeastern University released a report which suggests that technology will have a major impact on society. The report reflects on the future of technology and how it will affect different aspects of our lives, including work, education, and family life. 
One potential outcome is that more people will be employed through digital means. This could lead to an increase in income and wealth for those who can afford it, as well as fewer jobs available for those who cannot. It is also possible that this trend will lead to an increase in stress levels and tension within families. This could cause problems such as decreased productivity at work or increased absenteeism. 

Another potential outcome is that society may become more democratic.

How can a big idea be turned into a reality?
In business, big ideas are the lifeblood of success. They can be turned into reality with the right planning and execution. Here are five tips to make your big idea a reality:
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. When you know what your goals are, it's easier to prioritize and figure out how to reach them. This will help you draft an effective plan that will help you achieve your goals.

2. Make sure you have a compelling case for your big idea. Most businesses only do their best when they have a strong argument for why their product or service is worth existing. Make sure your case is clear, argumentative, and compelling enough to convince people to invest in your project - even if it's just for a couple of years!

3. crystallize your ideas into simple concepts.
