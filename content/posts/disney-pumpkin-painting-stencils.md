2. Take some time to think about what you want your brainstorming session to be about. What are the main topics that you want to cover? 
3. Get feedback from other people who will help you shape your ideas into a better idea. This can include fellow creatives, business owners, or other people in your industry.

What are some creative techniques?
Creative techniques can be anything from painting to sculpting to writing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, there are a number of creative techniques that can help you get the best results in your artwork. Here are three examples:
1. Use perspective to create depth and interest in your artwork. Perspective is important when it comes to creating images, so use it to great effect in your paintings and sculptures. By understanding how perspective works, you can exaggerate or avoid details that may not look as important on the surface.

2. Use light and shadow to create moods in your artwork. You can use light and dark tones to create moods in your work, or you can use them simply as means of adding atmosphere and character into your pieces. For example, if you want your artwork to feel suspenseful, try using light shadows against dark backgrounds.

In recent years, scientists have developed new ideas about how the brain works. One of these ideas is that the brain is divided into two parts, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher functions such as thinking, planning, and decision making. The hippocampus is responsible for memory storage and retrieval. These new ideas may help explain some of the psychiatric problems that people experience, such as depression and anxiety.
