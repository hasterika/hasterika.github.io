Tips for getting more out of creativity: From inspiration to principle to practice
When it comes to creativity, there are many different ways to approach it. However, one key factor is always to keep in mind the principle of creativity: It should be used for something new and exciting. Here are some tips on how to get more out of creativity:
1. Find inspiration from other sources. Whether you’re looking for ideas for a new piece of clothing or for a new way of thinking about an existing idea, looking at other cultures and their creative approaches can provide you with plenty of inspiration.

2. Think about principle. One of the most important things you can do when trying to come up with creative ideas is to think about what makes the idea special. What makes it unique? How will it be useful? these are all questions that can help you find the right principle behind your idea.

3. Practice and practice again.
