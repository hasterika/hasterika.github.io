1. Idea Submission: How do you go about submitting an idea?
When you want to submit an idea to a news outlet, there are a few things you need to do in order to make sure your submission is accepted. 
You first need to create a proposal, which will include information about the idea and why it should be included in the outlet's story. You can also find resources online that can help you with this process, such as The White House's website or the National Broadcasting Corporation's website. 
Next, you need to go through an editing process and make sure your idea is ready for publication. This may involve some changes, but it is important that your submission meets all requirements before it is sent for review. 
Once your idea has been edited and approved by staff at the outlet, you will then need to promote and sell your submission to potential customers.
