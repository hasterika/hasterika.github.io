The keynotes at the beginning of this paper explore new ideas in implementation but it is important to keep in mind that any new approaches should be tested and proven during a live trial before they can be implemented into an organizational structure. In this paper, the authors present three case studies that illustrate how different approaches to implementing change can have positive or negative results.

The role of invention in society: What are the biggest uses for innovation in society today?
Innovation has long been a key component of society. From the development of new technology to the improvement of food production, innovation has always been essential in order to keep society running smoothly and ensuring that everyone has access to the basics. 
However, there are a number of other spheres in which innovation can be used in society. For example, innovations in healthcare could lead to better treatments for patients and lessened costs; or innovations in transportation could make it easier for people to reach their destinations safely and efficiently. 

There is no one answer to whether or not innovation is important in society, but it is worth looking at how it can be used in different ways in order to ensure that everyone benefits from its impact.

2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.
