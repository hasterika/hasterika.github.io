How to Start and running a blog: How do you go about setting up and running your own blog, both online and in print?
Setting up and running your own blog can be a daunting task, but with some thoughtful planning and execution it can be a rewarding experience. Here are three tips to help you get started:

1. Invention ideas are always in flux, and since new technologies keep popping up, it’s hard to come up with anything that’s truly original.
