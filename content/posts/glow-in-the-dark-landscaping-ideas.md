The finished product: What does it look like and how does it work?
If you're like most people, you probably have a basic understanding of how a watch works and what it looks like. But if you're looking for tips on how to build your own watch, there's still a lot you don't know.  So, in this article, we'll take a look at how to make a simple wristwatch using only materials you likely have at home. 
So first off, all you need is some leather or plastic wrap and some screws. You'll also need an electric drill and some wood screws. Next, take the leather or plastic wrap and cut it into 1" pieces.

The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.
