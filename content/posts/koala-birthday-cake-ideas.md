What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that comes to mind, whether it's something new or something that has been done before. There are so many great creative ideas out there that it's hard to know where to start. Here are a few of our favourites: 
1. Idea: Have a creative picnic! This could involve having a picnic table set up in your backyard, eating your favourite food and discussing all of the different ideas you came up with while nourished by the sun and beautiful surroundings. 
2. Idea: Draw some Figures! One great way to get your creativity going is by drawing Figures. This could involve painting them on walls or using markers to create realistic drawings. It's important to find something that inspires you and works well for you, as different types of art can be very differing in how they inspire others.
