The Relationship of Art to Life: What is the purpose of art?
Creative art has a variety of purposes, some of which are more specific than others. For example, music is often used as a form of art to express emotions and thoughts. This can be done in a number of ways, including through the creation of songs or through dance. It can also be used to tell stories or to explore ideas about the human experience. In addition, creative art is often used as an outlet for people who don't have any other means of expression. This can include artists who are struggling with mental health issues, artists who are homeless or those who have no other way to share their ideas and feelings. There are many purposes for creative art and it ultimately depends on the individual's needs and wants.
