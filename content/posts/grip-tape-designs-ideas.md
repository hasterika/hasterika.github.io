How to keep your home clean and organized:
Keeping your home clean is not only easy but can also be fun. There are a variety of ways to keep your home clean, and some are easier than others. Here are two diy ideas that can help keep your home clean and organized:
1. Add a cleaning supplies organizer to the wall near the sink. This will help you see what supplies need to be cleaned and which ones can wait until later.
