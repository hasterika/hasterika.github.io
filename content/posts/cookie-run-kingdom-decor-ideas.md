Brainstroming can be found in different activities such as learning, working on a project, studying, or just being able to focus on something.

Definition of a "new idea"
A new idea is a re-interpretation or expansion of an old concept that has been brought to a new level of understanding or application. This can be accomplished through thought, creativity, or a mixture of the two. New ideas are always in flux and are constantly being developed and tweaked as more information is learned and considered.

Basics: What are the different creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and forms, but they all have one common goal: to make a difference. Whether you’re looking to create an idea for your next project or just start thinking about new ways to improve your skills, there are some basic tips to get you started. Here are four quick ideas for getting started:
1. Take a walk around your city and think about what might be possible with different transportation options. What would a more efficient commute look like? What if the bridges and tunnels were repurposed as public art spaces? These are just a few examples of how creativity can be used in everyday life.

2. Make something using materials that you already have on hand. This could mean recycling materials such as old cans or cups, or finding new sources of inspiration from nature.

What is the new idea?
The new idea is to use a smartwatch as a fitness tracker. People wear trackers all the time, so why not wear one on their wrist? This would be great for people who are already healthy and want to keep track of their fitness and activity levels. Another benefit of this technology is that it could be used as a communication device. You could use it to text or call someone while you are working out, or even while you are lying in bed.
