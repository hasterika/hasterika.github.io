2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own).

Innovation in healthcare: What new technologies are coming soon?
The healthcare industry is constantly developing new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Some of these innovations are coming soon, while others may still take some time to develop. Here are two examples of the latter. 
One technology is called "smart technology." This refers to devices that are specifically designed to improve patient care, such as providing real-time alerts or tracking patient vital signs. This can reduce the amount of time patients spend on their chart, make it easier for nurses to find needed medical supplies and personnel, and ensure that patients receive the best possible care. 

The other innovation is called "telemedicine." This refers to delivery of medical care over the Internet or other digital platforms. telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by cutting costs and increasing efficiency.
