Origin of Invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for an invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that was not originally planned or conceived by someone else. It can be anything from building a new computer to creating a new type of sauce. Inventions have been around for centuries, but their origins are still unknown. One possible explanation for the birth of invention is that somebody came up with the idea in their head and then put it into practice. Another theory suggests that somebody else helped develop the original idea before it was put into action. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question – each person’s experience and knowledge will likely differ on how they came up with the original product or idea.

Innovation: How can new ideas be brought to market and be successful?
New ideas are one of the most important things that a company can bring to market. Successful companies have been able to develop new ideas that go beyond the standard and bring in new customers and profits. Here are some tips on how to bring your new idea to market:
1. Be prepared for rejection

This might be due to a lack of innovation, or it could be because your product is not yet available in an affordable price point. Regardless, make sure you are prepared to face rejection and continue working on your idea until it becomes a reality.

2. Be persistent
