What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

Cultural aspects of Invention: How do people React to Innovation?
When someone comes up with a new invention, people often react in different ways. Some people may be excited by the idea, while others may be skeptical. Still others may just be curious. Different reactions mean that different people have different perspectives on innovation. 
One example of how people react to innovation is through patenting. Patenting an invention means that somebody has made something that is exclusive to them and can't be copied or used by anyone else. This can help protect the inventor's work from being copied or used without permission. 

Another example of how people react to innovation is through creativity. When somebody comes up with a new idea, they may be inspired by it or they might not be. It all depends on the person and their perspective on innovation.
