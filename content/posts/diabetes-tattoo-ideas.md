Ideas are a great source of inspiration and can be used in different ways to improve someone's life. Sometimes, ideas can be used for good, such as creating a new idea for a project, coming up with a new plan to improve upon an old one, or finding a new way to do something. Other times, ideas can be used for bad, such as inventing a new product that no one will ever buy, or coming up with a plan to fail at something.

Creative expressions: What are they and how do they differ from regular expressions?
Creative expressions are different from regular expressions in that they make use of the imagination to create new and unique sentences. They can be used to match text against a set of specific criteria, or to identify patterns in text.
While regular expressions are widely used in text Morgan Kaufmann offers a number of creative expression tools to help you create more interesting and innovative sentences. These tools can be found on the left-hand side of the main Morgan Kaufmann page, under “Creative Expression”.
