What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.

Conclusion
Innovation has the ability to create new value for businesses and organizations, but it must be managed carefully in order to be successful. The process of innovation involves four distinct stages: ideation, development, commercialization, and scaling. Each stage presents its own challenges and opportunities, but the rewards can be great if innovation is managed effectively.
Organizations that innovate successfully tend to have a few key attributes in common. They are open to new ideas, willing to take risks, and have a culture that supports creativity and experimentation. They also have a clear understanding of their customers’ needs and how they can be met in new ways.

 Innovation is essential for businesses to thrive in today’s ever-changing marketplace. But it’s not enough to simply have good ideas – they must be executed well in order to create lasting value.
