Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a critical component of any creative organization. Whether it’s a small business, an artist, or a team of creatives, creativity is essential to making anything happen. There are many types of creativity, but three that are most important to businesses and artists alike are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. 
Visual creativity refers to the ability to see something and create ideas based on that. This can be done through drawing or painting, but often starts with seeing the idea in your head and then coming up with ways to turn it into a reality. Auditory creativity comes from creating sounds and melodies based on what you hear. This can be done through music creation or sound engineering, but often starts with imagining how the sound could be used in an application or project. Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the ability to touch something and create ideas based on that.

Tips For Creating More Effective Art: What tips can you give to help improve your artwork?
When it comes to creating effective art, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some tips that may help improve your work: 
1. Start with a good idea. When you have an idea for an artwork, the next step is to develop it into a complete work. This means working on the ideas and concepts behind your piece before starting on the actual painting or sculpture. 

2. Take advantage of constructive criticism. A lot of times it’s helpful to get feedback from other people in order to improve your pieces. It will also give you a better understanding of what worked and what didn’t work in your work overall. 

3. Be persistent. The best way to stay motivated when painting or sculpture is to keep pushing yourself.
