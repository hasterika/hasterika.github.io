Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.

The opportunities for big ideas:
There are endless opportunities for big ideas. In fact, many of the world's most innovative companies were started with just a single idea. And while it might seem daunting to come up with a truly groundbreaking concept, there are plenty of ways to get started. Here are four tips for generating big ideas: 1) Brainstorm with others. Collaborating with others can help spark new ideas and increase the chances of success. 2) Don't be afraid to experiment. Trying out new approaches often leads to breakthroughs. 3) Be open to change. Constantly adapting your approach will help you stay ahead of the competition. 4) Stay focused on the task at hand. If you lose focus, your ideas will quickly go away.
