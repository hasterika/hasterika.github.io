The 4 types of creativity: Intrinsic, extrinsic, creative accident, and creative process.
Creative process is the sum total of all the steps that go into producing a work of art. Intrinsic creativity comes from within; extrinsic creativity is based on external factors, such as the environment or the people around someone. Creative accidents happen when something goes wrong while trying to create something, usually resulting in a new and different way of looking at things. The creative process is a never-ending journey, and it can be unpredictable.
