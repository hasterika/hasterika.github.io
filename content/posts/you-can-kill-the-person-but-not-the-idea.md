What are big ideas?
Ideas are what change the world. They are what can make a difference in your life. Whether you're looking to start something new orto keep an old idea alive, big ideas are essential to any successful project. Here's how to come up with some of your own: 
-Think outside the box: There's no one right way to approach big ideas, but taking a different approach can often lead to more creative and successful outcomes. By thinking outside the box, you can come up with concepts that may not have been considered before. 

-Be persistent: Big ideas take time and effort to develop into something viable and successful. Don't be afraid to put in the hard work – it'll pay off in the end.

Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).
