What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.

Idea 2: A way to track fitness progress and keep track of calories burned.
There are many ways to track fitness progress and calories burned, but one popular way is to use a pedometer. A pedometer tracks steps taken and the number of calories burned, which can be helpful in understanding how much exercise you're doing and how much weight you've lost. Another common way to track fitness progress is to use a Garminbrace. This tracking device records your physical activity data and stores it on a computer. You can then see your average caloric burn for each day or week, as well as your overall progress over time.

Innovation: How can you make your inventions more successful?
Inventions can be a great way to make your business more successful. By coming up with new ways to do things, you can make your products or services more affordable and accessible, or even create new markets for them. Here are four tips for making your inventions more successful:
1. Think about what customers want. When you come up with an invention, think about the needs that your target market might have. What are the products or services that you could offer that would meet those needs?
2. Look at the competition. Make sure that you’re not just copying someone else’s idea, but coming up with a better solution that will be more popular and successful. There are always new opportunities out there for businesses to succeed, so don’t be afraid to creativity and risk taking!

Idea 1: Why did this idea come to mind?
This idea came to mind because of my son's 6th grade science project. In it, he was trying to figure out why a bee falls off of a tree. He found that the bee's wings would eventually break and they would fall to the ground. He thought this could be a fun experiment to do with his classmates.
