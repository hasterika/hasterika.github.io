legal aspects of Invention: What are the rules surrounding invention?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea,product or method. It can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that invention is "the creation of something new out of nothing." Many countries have laws that regulate the creation and use of inventions. In some cases, these laws are more important than others, and they can play a decisive role in whether an invention becomes a commercial success.
There are three types of law governing invention: trade secrets, copyrights and patents.trade secrets usually relate to technology or business ideas, while copyrights protect creative works such as novels, motion pictures and computer programs. Patents allow inventors to exclusive use their ideas for a period of time, which can make it difficult for other people to adopt or use an invention.
