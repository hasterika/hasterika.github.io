Creative ideas are like seeds. They can be sown in any direction, but they will eventually germinate and produce a flower.

Commercialization: How can inventors develop their inventions into successful businesses?
There are a variety of ways to turn inventions into successful businesses, depending on the inventor and the business opportunity. 
One way is for an inventor to commercialize their invention. This can be done through a variety of ways, including selling the invention to a company, licensing the invention, or working with a business to help develop new products or services. 

Another way is for an inventor to work on their invention full time and then sell their product when it becomes available. This is an option if the inventor has a strong idea for a product or service that they believe could be successful. However, it can be difficult to make money from an invention this way. 
The third way is for an inventor to find someone who has an existing product or service that they could use as a model for their own product.

The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process. This means that all ideas should be welcomed and explored, no matter how “out there” they may seem at first. Secondly, it is helpful to set a time limit for each brainstorming session.
