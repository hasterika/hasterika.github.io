The brainstroming phenomenon is a curious and sometimes inexplicable phenomenon that can be observed when people are thinking deeply or concentrating on a task. The most common form of brainstroming is when someone's thoughts flow evenly and smoothly from one area of their mind to another. However, there are also cases where thoughts shift abruptly and randomly different parts of the brain can fire simultaneously. This sudden switch in focus can cause people to achieve great insights or achieve goals they never thought possible.
