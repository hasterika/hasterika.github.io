Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy.

2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.
