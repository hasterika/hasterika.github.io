The impact of inventions: What people and businesses are doing with invented products now
Invention is a word that has been used for centuries to describe creativity and innovation. Today, it is used more specifically to describe the process of creating something new. Inventions can be from small ideas to revolutionary products. The impact of inventions on businesses and people is often difficult to measure, but there are a number of ways in which they can have an impact. 
One way in which inventions can have a significant impact on businesses is by providing new ways to make money. Businesses that use invented products more often find that they can make more money and do better with their products because they now have a solution that was not possible before. Additionally, businesses can find that they need to change their marketing strategy if they hope to catch up with those who have been using invented products for years. 

People also play a role in the impact of inventions.
