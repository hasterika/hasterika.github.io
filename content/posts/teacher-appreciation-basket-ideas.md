Brainstroming (So what?) is a process that occurs when the brain migrates from one part of your brain to another. In some cases, this migration can be beneficial; for example, during puberty, the brain shifts from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe. But in other cases, it can create problems. For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.

Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.
