properties of innovation:
Innovation is a process of change that occurs when a new idea, product or service becomes more popular than the existing ones. Innovation can be seen as an exciting opportunity for businesses to create new products and services that improve their customers’ lives. The key to success in innovation is to have a strong vision and plan for the innovation, which can be difficult if the business does not have enough resources or if it does not have the rightpeople on board.
