Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
When it comes to innovation, there are a few key differences that can be observed. For one, innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas or products; it also includes taking risks and trying something new in order to create something better. This is what makes innovation so important – it allows companies to constantly improve their products and services while also taking advantage of new opportunities.
But the main difference between innovation and other types of innovation is that innovation is not always about money. In fact, some people argue that innovation should only be considered when it creates value for society as a whole – otherwise, it’s just called “innovation” by those in the business world. However, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t always a cost associated with innovative work – in fact, there often is.

How to overcome creative blocks:
When it comes to being creative, sometimes the hardest part is getting started. If you're feeling stuck, here are a few tips to help you overcome those creative blocks and get those ideas flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, all you need is a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This can help refresh your mind and give you a new perspective on how to approach your project.

2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them. Hearing from others can jumpstart your own creativity.
