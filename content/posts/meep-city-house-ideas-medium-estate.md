How to come up with big ideas
Every day, we are bombarded with new ideas. However, it can be hard to come up with big ideas. Here are some tips to help you get started: 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be difficult to know where to start. Try creating a table of contents or making a list of the key points in each section. This will help you get started on finding the best ideas. 
2. Be open to feedback: Take on many different types of feedback before you submit your idea for consideration. This will give you a better understanding of what people want and how they would benefit from your product or service. 
3. Don’t be afraid to change: One of the most important things when coming up with big ideas is being willing to change your plan based on feedback.
