2020: What were some of the biggest challenges and opportunities faced in 2020?
In 2020, some of the biggest challenges facing the United States and other democracies were the rise in populism and xenophobia, as well as economic volatility. However, there also opportunities for progress. The biggest challenge facing the US was the increasing support for secessionist movements such as the "Brexit" vote in Britain and the workshopping of a new tax code that would have lowered rates for businesses. Other key issues include Bureaucratic red tape, healthcare reform, and gun control. In Europe, problems including Brexit and population growth made it difficult to agree on policies to address these issues. Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for progress. For example, in France, Emmanuel Macron has been successful in making his country more competitive by focusing on innovation and job creation. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is working to reduce social inequality by creating jobs in the economy.

Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether you’re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.
