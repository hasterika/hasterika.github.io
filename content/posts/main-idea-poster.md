Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.
