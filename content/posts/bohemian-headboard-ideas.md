The value of creativity: What it is, how it can be used, and why it matters
Creativity is a important factor in any organization or enterprise. From product development and marketing to business strategy and communications, creativity is needed on all levels. There are many reasons why creativity can be so valuable, and one of the most important is that it can help solve problems.
One of the simplest ways to increase creativity is by providing an environment where people can express themselves freely. In an environment where creativity is encouraged, people are more likely to come up with ideas that may not have been thought of before. This can lead to new solutions being proposed, or even new products or services being created.

Another reason why creativity is so valuable is because it can be used to solve problems. When something feels impossible or difficult, often times creative minds are able to come up with solutions that seem impossible at first glance.

Big ideas are those that could have a significant impact on the world. They can be things that people have never thought of, or ideas that are relatively new and unexplored. Sometimes these big ideas are developed by teams of people working together, and sometimes they are created by someone who is just thinking out loud. Regardless of who came up with the idea, it is important to diffuse it and see if anyone else can come up with a better option.
