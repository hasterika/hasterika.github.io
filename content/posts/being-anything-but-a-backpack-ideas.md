2020: The year of the moon

And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface.
