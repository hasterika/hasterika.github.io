Factors that influence the definition of a big idea
There are many factors that can influence the definition of a big idea. Some of these include the idea's popularity, its feasibility, and its novelty. Popularity is important because it can help to determine whether or not people are interested in the idea. Feasibility is important because it determines how easily the idea can be implemented. Its feasibility will also depend on whether or not someone has an understanding of the concept. Finally, novelty is important because it can change people's opinions on an issue. This can lead to a change in the way people think about the idea and potential implementation.

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.
