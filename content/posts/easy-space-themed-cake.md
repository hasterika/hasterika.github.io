Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers. For example, Google created Street View in order to allow people to see how their cities look from close up. This type of innovation is often used for education and marketing purposes. Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers. For example, Apple Watch was developed as a way for people to keep track of their time and step-by-step exercises without having to carry a phone around. This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.

Positive effects of creativity: What’s the best way to use creativity to its fullest potential?
Creativity is a powerful tool that can be used in a number of ways to improve our lives. One way is by using it to come up with new ideas and concepts. Another way is by creating things that haven t been done before. There are a number of different ways to use creativity, but the best way to use it for the most positive effect is by trying out different methods and philosophies. Here are three examples:
1. Use creativity to come up with new ideas for businesses.

Some businesses try to remain stagnant and traditional because they are afraid of change, but using creativity can help them overcome this fear. By coming up with new ideas, they can expand their services and reach more customers than if they were just following the same routine. This is especially true if they have an existing customer base who are willing to be open-minded and give them another chance.

Other times, ideas can be things that you've been working on for a while and you've just started thinking about them again. But whatever the case may be, ideas are something that everyone needs.
