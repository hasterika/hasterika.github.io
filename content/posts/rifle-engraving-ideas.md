The power of creativity: How can it help you succeed?
Creativity is a powerful tool that can help you succeed in any field. By using creativity, you can come up with new ideas and strategies that can help you achieve your goals. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using creativity as a tool: first, be realistic about what you want to achieve. Don't expect to create something overnight or from scratch; rather, use creativity as an engine to help you realize your goals. Additionally, be sure that your creative ideas are feasible and achievable. If they aren't, you may find it difficult to implement them into reality. Finally, don't forget the importance of practice! The more time you spend practicing your creative processes, the better equipped you will be for anything that comes your way â€“ whether it's creating new ideas or finishing projects.

1. Create a custom desk with an old dresser
If you're like most people, your work desk is more a collection of random pieces of furniture than an organized working space. It's easy to get disorganized when you don't have a specific goal in mind when designing your desk. So how do you create an actual working space for yourself? One way is to find an old dresser and turn it into a custom desk. You can use the drawer space for storage, or simply use the top drawer as a place to put your computer, printer, and other office supplies. This project can be completed in just a few hours, and it's a great way to show off your skills as an architect.

Ideas for transportation: What can we do to improve transportation?
How can we improve transportation? 
There are many ways to improve transportation, but here are some ideas for transportation that could be implemented in 2022.

1. More public transportation: Government and non-profit organizations should work together to create more public transportation. This would help decrease traffic congestion and provide a more efficient way to get around town.
2. Improved bike infrastructure: Bicycles can play an important role in improving transportation, as they are environmentally friendly and easy to ride. Bike lanes should be built in major cities so people can easily access the rest of the city without having to navigate through traffic. 
3. Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles have many potential benefits for transportation, including reducing pollution and saving money on fuel expenses.
