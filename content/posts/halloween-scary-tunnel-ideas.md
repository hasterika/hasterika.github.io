Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).

Definition of creativity: Pixar's Bob Crandall said "Creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected."
In an industry where creativity is often measured in terms of output, Pixar's Bob Crandall said that creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected. This definition has helped the animation studio create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking films in history, including Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Ratatouille.
While it may be a cliché to say that creativity comes from the ability to think outside the box, Crandall's definition actually provides a more accurate definition for what makes creative individuals successful. By understanding how creativity works, businesses can better define their own goals and strategies for becoming more creative.
