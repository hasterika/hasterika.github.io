Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design that no one else has come up with before. It can be something as simple as a new way to make a product, or something more complex like the invention of the car. Inventions have changed the way we live and work, and they have even led to new technologies and industries.

The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.
