The finished product: What does it look like and how does it work?
If you're like most people, you probably have a basic understanding of how a watch works and what it looks like. But if you're looking for tips on how to build your own watch, there's still a lot you don't know.  So, in this article, we'll take a look at how to make a simple wristwatch using only materials you likely have at home. 
So first off, all you need is some leather or plastic wrap and some screws. You'll also need an electric drill and some wood screws. Next, take the leather or plastic wrap and cut it into 1" pieces.

The challenges of innovation: What needs to be done to make it successful?
Innovation is key to keeping businesses on the right track, but it can also be difficult to get started. Here are four challenges that need to be overcome in order for innovation to stay successful: 1) Lack of experience: Many businesses start out with little or no experience in their field. Without a good foundation, it can be hard to build on what has been done before. This often results in poor innovation and product development. 2) Poor communication: When trying to come up with new ideas, it can be difficult to communicate these effectively and efficiently. This can lead to problems such as miscommunication and confusion over what is being discussed. 3) Lack of coordination: In order for innovation to work well, it needs to be coordinated between different departments within a company. This can be difficult when there are different interests and goals at play.

It also helps businesses to keep up with changes in technology and to stay competitive against other companies. Some benefits of innovation include: 
- Increased sales - When a business embraces innovation, it can get its products and services into more people's hands. This means that more people can buy them, which in turn leads to increased profits.

Invention as a product: How does an invention change the world?
Invention can be defined in a number of ways, but perhaps the most concise way is to say that an invention is a new way of doing something. Inventions have the potential to change how people live, work, and play and can make the world a better place. Some embodiments of this idea are more tangible than others, but all inventions offer potential for change.
