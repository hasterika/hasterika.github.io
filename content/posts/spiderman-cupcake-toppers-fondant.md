What are some creative techniques?
Creative techniques can be anything from painting to sculpting to writing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, there are a number of creative techniques that can help you get the best results in your artwork. Here are three examples:
1. Use perspective to create depth and interest in your artwork. Perspective is important when it comes to creating images, so use it to great effect in your paintings and sculptures. By understanding how perspective works, you can exaggerate or avoid details that may not look as important on the surface.

2. Use light and shadow to create moods in your artwork. You can use light and dark tones to create moods in your work, or you can use them simply as means of adding atmosphere and character into your pieces. For example, if you want your artwork to feel suspenseful, try using light shadows against dark backgrounds.

Creative process: What happens during the creative process?
Creative processes can vary depending on the person and the creative work they are working on. For example, one person might be creative during brainstorming sessions while another might need to be more specific in their ideas before starting to create anything. However, there are some commonalities between all creative people. They tend to be open-minded, multi-talented and want to explore new ideas constantly. The process of creativity is often seen as a journey, not a destination.
