The benefits of creative art: What are some of the benefits of being a creative person?
Creative art can be both therapeutic and functional. Therapeutic in that it can help to clear away any emotional or material debris that has built up in the individual, and functional as it can help people to express themselves in a new and unique way. There are many benefits to creative art, but some of the most important ones include: 
1. It can help people to take a step back from their everyday lives and see things from a different perspective.
2. It can provide an escape from the mundane tasks that require daily routine, and also give people an opportunity to reflect on their feelings and thoughts. 
3. It can provideah opportunity for self-expression that is often overshadowed by more pressing concerns. 
4. It can stimulate thought processes, which can lead to better problem solving skills.
