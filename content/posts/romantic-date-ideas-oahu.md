How to improve sleep: how can you get the most out of your sleep?
There are a few things you can do to improve your sleep quality and quantity. Some of these ideas may seem like small changes, but if done consistently, they can make a big impact on your productivity and overall well-being. Here are four easy tips to get the most out of your slumber: 
1. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep: The best way to achieve good sleep is by sleeping at least eight hours per night. If you don’t have time for that, try timing yourself so that you get at least six hours of sleep each night. 

2. Have a bedtime routine: Make sure to bed down at a reasonable time and have a regular wake-up/bedtime routine. This will help you get the best amount of rest before going back to sleep.
