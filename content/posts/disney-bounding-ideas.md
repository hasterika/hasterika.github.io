Types of creativity: There are three types of creativity: mental, physical, and emotional.
Creativity is a mental process that involves the use of one's own ideas and imagination. Creative individuals may also utilize physical or emotional methods to create something new. Mental creativity occurs when an individual is able to come up with new ideas and solutions without any prior knowledge or experience. Physical creativity is when an individual uses their body to create something new. Emotional creativity occurs when an individual uses their emotions in order to create something new.
