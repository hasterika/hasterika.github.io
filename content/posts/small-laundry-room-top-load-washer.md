The history of AI: How has AI been developed over the years?
A key part of any AI development is understanding the motivations behind the work. This history can be broken down into three periods: the1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time. The 1980s saw a shift towards using AI for good; however, this shift was met with criticism from some who felt that AI had become excessive in its power.

Offering a new product or service
A new product or service can be a big idea. It can be something that is different and exciting, or it can be something that is helpful and necessary. Whether it is a new way to cook your food, or a new way to keep your home clean, there are many options when it comes to creating a new product or service. 
One of the best things about offering a new product or service is that people are always curious. They want to see what it is and how it works. This curiosity can lead to increased sales for your company, as people want to know more about what you have to offer.
