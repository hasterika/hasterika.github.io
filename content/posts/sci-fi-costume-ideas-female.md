The Idea: What is it? How can it be used?
Ideas are a great way to come up with new ideas. Some ideas are simple, while others may be more complex. However, they can all be used to improve the success of a project or to come up with new solutions to problems. Here are four examples of how ideas can be used in a project: 
1. A brainstorming session is a great way to get creative and come up with new ideas for a project.
2. If you have some specific goals for the project, you can use brainstorming sessions to help you achieve those goals.
3. Use ideas as part of your development process and see what comes out the most effective in terms of coming up with new solutions.
