The process of coming up with ideas: What tools do you need?
Ideas are hard to come by, but they're worth trying to get. There are a few tools that can help you come up with more ideas, but it takes time and effort. Here are some tips to help you get started: 1. Take some time for yourself. A lot of people think that if they just sit in front of their computer all day, they'll have great ideas. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. If you need some time for yourself, go for a walk or take a bath; those activities will give you an idea of what's important to you and when you might want to come back to your work. 2. Get inspiration from others. People around you can be a great source of inspiration when it comes time to come up with new ideas.
