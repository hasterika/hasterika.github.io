What are some of the challenges you face when trying new ideas?
There are a number of challenges that can come about when trying new ideas. Some of these challenges may include: difficulty in getting others to embrace the idea, derailed progress because of creative differences, and confusion over what is truly important when it comes to implementing the idea. However, even if these obstacles don't seem insurmountable, they can still cause setbacks and make it difficult to see the value in pursuing an idea. It's important to remember that ideas are worth pursuing, regardless of the obstacles that may be encountered along the way. So whether you're facing difficulty adapting or disagreement over how best to use an 8-bit game as your business model, remember that ideas are worth fighting for.

The role of big ideas in history
The role of big ideas in history is essential for understanding the past and shaping the future. Big ideas have the power to change the course of history, and they often do. From the American Revolution to the civil rights movement, big ideas have shaped our world.
Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are small and only affect a few people, while others are large and have a global impact. No matter their size, all big ideas have the potential to change the world.

History is full of examples of big ideas that have changed the course of events. The American Revolution was sparked by a few key individuals who had big ideas about freedom and democracy. These ideas spread like wildfire, eventually leading to independence from Britain.

The civil rights movement was another example of a big idea changing history.
