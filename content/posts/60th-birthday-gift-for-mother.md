How to: Start with the most common projects and work your way up
If you're just starting out, there are a few things to keep in mind when embarking on your first DIY project. First and foremost, don't be afraid to ask for help – everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to construction. And if you have any trouble understanding something or struggling with a project, don't worry; anyone can learn from experience.
Of course, no one is born knowing how to do everything by themselves – that's where the importance of having some type of plan comes in. Not only will this help you avoid becoming overwhelmed and frustrated, but it'll also make sure that your projects get completed on time and without any unforeseen problems. So go ahead and start building – it's the least you can do!

Brainstroming is a mental puzzle game that can be played on your computer or phone. Players use their brain to guess the order of cards in a deck, and then put them back in the deck so that the next card is at the bottom. The game is scoreless, but players can win by guessing the order of cards in an opponent's deck and putting them back in place so that their own card is at the top.
