Definition of creativity: How do we define creativity?
Creativity is a relative term. Many people believe that creativity = doing something new and original. Others would say it's the ability to come up with ideas or solutions that no one else has thought of before. The definition for creativity has changed over time, but the process remains the same- coming up with new and innovative ways to do things. Whether it’s painting, designing, or writing, creative individuals have always been able to bring their A game to whatever they do.

What are some easy and effective ways to improve your home’s energy efficiency?
There are many easy and effective ways to improve your home's energy efficiency, but it depends on your needs and what you're targeting. Here are a few tips:
1. Improve insulation - An improved insulation will help reduce your home's energy bill by reducing the amount of heat that comes in and out. Start by making sure all of your walls and ceilings are installed with at least 1/2 inch of R-Value.

2. Add window air conditioners - If you havewindows that open into small spaces or if the windows don't have fans, adding window air conditioners can save you a lot of money in the long run.
