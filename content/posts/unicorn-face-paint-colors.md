Editing andpublishing: What steps do you take after coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be a daunting task, but it's important to first take steps to editing and publishing your ideas. Once you've created some great concepts, it's important to make sure that they're properly accessible and saleable. Here are some key steps to follow:
1. Establish your tone and voice. Once you've come up with a good concept, it's important to establish a tone in order to sell it. You don't want your idea to come off as cheesy or written by someone who is just trying to cash in. Be sure that your idea has an interesting plot, strong visuals, and interesting dialogue.

2. Research your marketability. Once you have a solid tone and voice, it's time to research the marketability of your ideas. Do you have an existing audience? Are your concepts easy to understand?

Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.
