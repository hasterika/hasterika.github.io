What is creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be described in many ways, but one definition of creativity is "the power of the imagination." It can be used to create things that we never thought possible, or to come up with new ways to do things we've been thinking about for years. Some people say that creativity is what makes us human, and it's what makes us most creative.

Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.

The power of inspiration: How can we use it to our advantage?
Inspiration is one of the most powerful tools we have. It can help us come up with new ideas, take on new challenges, and find solutions to problems. However, how can it be used to our advantage? Here are five ways: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings: Check out your neighborhood, visit museums, or even watch movies to get a sense for what inspires you. This can help you come up with new ideas for projects or products. 
2) Use inspiration to create things you love: If you’re a creative person, why not use your creativity to create things that you enjoy? Maybe you like making art or designing furniture, or you just enjoy spending time in nature. These activities can help give you an idea of what might inspire future projects.
