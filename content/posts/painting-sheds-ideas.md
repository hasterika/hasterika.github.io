How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from traditional methods of production and consumption?
Innovations, according to most definitions, are changes in the way things are done that make them more efficient or effective. However, innovation can also refer to different methods of production and consumption – changes in how we produce and consume goods and services.
Traditional methods of production and consumption have been around for centuries, but they have certain limitations. For example, traditional farming practices require a lot of manual labor to produce goods and services. This means that people who work on traditional farms generally do not have access to high-quality products or services.

On the other hand, new technologies and innovations can allow people to produce goods and services without any human involvement. For example, computer-generated images (CGIs) can be used to create realistic 3D images that are then used by companies to sell products.
