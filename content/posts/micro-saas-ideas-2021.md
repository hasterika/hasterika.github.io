Definition of innovation: The process of coming up with a new, original idea or product.
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new, original idea or product. Innovation can come in many forms, but it's most commonly used when someone comes up with a new way to do something. Innovation can be seen as the result of ideas and exploration, as well as the courage to take risks. For example, Apple was able to come up with the iPhone thanks to their innovation. In order for innovation to work, there must be a clear vision and an understanding of what people want and need. This requires creativity and risk-taking, both of which are something that often isn't easy to find in most businesses.

What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.

What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.
