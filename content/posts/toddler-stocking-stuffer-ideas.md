The Benefits of Thinking Out Loud: How to get started
With so many things going on in our lives, it can be difficult to focus. It's easy to forget that we have the power to think and change the world. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
1) Get organized. When you're not focusing, it can be difficult to stay on track with your goals. Make a list of your top accomplishments and objective, and then find ways to achieve them through effort and planning. 
2) Take action. Sometimes all it takes is taking some action towards your objective- even if it's just writing down what you plan to do next. This will help keep you motivated as well as give yourself an idea of how far you've come already. 
3)「What if?」 Thinking about possibilities can help increase your confidence when making decisions.

The benefits of brainstroming: What it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming, also known as “brainstorming,” is a process by which teams can come up with new ideas and strategies faster and more easily than when they are spread out among individuals. Brainstroming can be used in business, engineering, marketing, and many other areas of work. Here are three reasons why brainstroming is important: 
1. Brainstroming can help you come up with Faster Ideas: When you brainstorm with others, you may end up coming up with concepts that are different from what was initially proposed. This allows you to be more creative and efficient when it comes to coming up with solutions. 
2. Brainstroming Can Help You Come Up With Moreorthern Ideas: When team members brainstorm together, they often come up with ideas that are outside the scope of the original proposal.
