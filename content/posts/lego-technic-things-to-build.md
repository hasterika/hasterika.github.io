How to declutter your home using easy and affordable methods
decluttering your home is a great way to improve your quality of life and make it more organized. There are a variety of easy, affordable declutter methods that can help you get rid of clutter and improve your home. Here are a few examples:
1. Use bins and boxes to store seasonal items. This will help you keep your home free from clutter during the offseason, when there is less demand for space.

2. Create racks or shelves to hold items that can be used multiple times or kept in rotation. This will help you keep your home clean and organized while you use it again next year.

3. Place empty boxes, cans, cups, or other small objects on the floor where they will not block traffic or create noise. This will help you declutter quickly and easily without having to think about it too much.

Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether youâ€™re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.
