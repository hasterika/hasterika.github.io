The Different Types of Brainstroming:
As we all know, brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden, unexpected thoughts or ideas. Brainstroming can be negative or helpful, and it can be associated with brainstorming sessions or creative thinking. There are three main types of brainstroming: cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal. 
Cognitivebrainstroming is when someone has a suddenZ wave-like experience in their mind that includes new and innovative thought. These thoughts may be related to something that the person has been working on for months or years but never considered before. Emotionalbrainstroming is when someone experiences intense emotions such as joy, sadness, worry, or anger. It can be overwhelming to try and contain these feelings and they will often take over the person's mind completely.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.

Creativity is an important component of any innovation process. However, some challenges that can arise when creativity is used in innovation include: 1) lack of clarity on what needs to be done in order for a new idea to be successful; 2) the need to develop a clear business case for the innovation; and 3) the power of suggestion when it comes to new ideas.
