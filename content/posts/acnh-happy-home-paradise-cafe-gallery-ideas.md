Types of innovation: Product, process, service, and market.
Innovation is a key part of business. It allows companies to new ways of doing things and improve their products and services. Innovation can take many forms, including product, process, service, and market innovations. 
Product innovation is about coming up with a new way to do something. For example, a company could come up with a new way to make coffee that tastes better or be more environmentally-friendly. Process innovation is about making processes easier or faster so they can be done more efficiently. For example, a company could come up with a new way to produce food that is more consistent across different brands or produce food in less time than ever before. Service innovation is about making services better or easier to use so customers can have better experiences. For example, a company could create an online store that is easy to navigate or offer free shipping on orders over $70.

what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.
