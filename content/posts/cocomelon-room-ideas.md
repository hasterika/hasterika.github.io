How to: Start with the most common projects and work your way up
If you're just starting out, there are a few things to keep in mind when embarking on your first DIY project. First and foremost, don't be afraid to ask for help – everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to construction. And if you have any trouble understanding something or struggling with a project, don't worry; anyone can learn from experience.
Of course, no one is born knowing how to do everything by themselves – that's where the importance of having some type of plan comes in. Not only will this help you avoid becoming overwhelmed and frustrated, but it'll also make sure that your projects get completed on time and without any unforeseen problems. So go ahead and start building – it's the least you can do!

Definition of Innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of change in a product or service. It can be defined as a new way of doing something, or an alteration in the way that something is done. Innovation can come from people or businesses, and it can happen in a number of different ways. 
One common definition of innovation is "the use of new ideas, methods and approaches to solve problems." This definition includes many different aspects to innovation, including business models, product design, marketing strategy and even customer service. It's important to note that innovation doesn't have to happen only in the context of business; it can also occur within individual teams or startups. 

The most distinguishing feature of innovation is its impact on society. Innovation can mean different things for different industries, but one thing that's always included is the idea of creating value for others.

The four steps to creating ideas: problem solving, coming up with a good title, writing a proposal, and taking action.
1. Get clear about what you want to achieve. What are your goals? What is the problem that you want to solve? 
2. Brainstorm a group of people who can help you develop your ideas. This can be a group of friends, family, or co-workers. 
3. Brainstorm a title for your project. This will give you an idea of what your project will be called and help organize all the different parts of your project together. 
4. Write out your proposal for potential investors or clients. This will give them a detailed account of what you plan to do and why it’s important for them to invest in your project.

Invention history: What inspired various inventors to come up with new ideas?
Invention history is a fascinating topic to explore, as it offers insights into the creativity and motivation behind inventors. Some of the most famous and influential inventors in history include Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Each inventor had their own unique ideas that led to new technologies and products. In some cases, these ideas were simply firsts – for example, da Vinci’s drawing of a three-dimensional image in paper was the first use of a technical drawing instrument in history. However, other inventions may have had more significant impacts on society or the economy. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the development of mass produced products like cars and machines. This theory also helped to change how people view themselves and their environment – thanks in part to his invention of the scientific method.
