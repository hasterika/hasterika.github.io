Creative process is the process that goes behind the creation of any artwork. This can be anything from a simple idea to a masterpiece. There are many different steps that go into creating an artwork, and it can be difficult to determine which one is responsible for the finished product.

1. Brainstorming: Brainstorming is when you come up with ideas for art and discuss them with others. This helps you come up with new ideas and ways to improve upon old ones.
