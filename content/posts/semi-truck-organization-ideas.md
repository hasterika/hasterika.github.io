How can people start thinking about new ideas?
Most people think of ideas when they are brainstorming, but there are other ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective. Here are three tips to help you get started: 
1. Give yourself time: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to allow yourself time to think about them. Don’t try to come up with any ideas in an instant. Take your time and consider everything that you have said before coming up with a new idea. 

2. Be open-minded: Once you have considered some potential ideas, it’s important that you be open-minded about them. If something doesn’t sound right or feels too farfetched, don’t be afraid to change your mind after thinking about it more. Remember that every idea has at least one potential application.

But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
