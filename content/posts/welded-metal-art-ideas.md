The value of creativity: What it is, how it can be used, and why it matters
Creativity is a important factor in any organization or enterprise. From product development and marketing to business strategy and communications, creativity is needed on all levels. There are many reasons why creativity can be so valuable, and one of the most important is that it can help solve problems.
One of the simplest ways to increase creativity is by providing an environment where people can express themselves freely. In an environment where creativity is encouraged, people are more likely to come up with ideas that may not have been thought of before. This can lead to new solutions being proposed, or even new products or services being created.

Another reason why creativity is so valuable is because it can be used to solve problems. When something feels impossible or difficult, often times creative minds are able to come up with solutions that seem impossible at first glance.

The history of invention: How have some inventions been used and what benefits have they brought?
Invention ideas are a core part of the history of technology. From ancient times to the present, people have come up with new ways to do things. Some inventions have been helpful and others have not. The history of invention is full of examples of both. Here are three examples:
The incandescent light bulb was first invented in 1879 by Jewish inventor Samuel Morse. It used a filament that was heated by an oven to create light.

The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Phonograph Company president Edward Emmons and his brother George. They created a machine that could play sound files on a screen.

The modern computer was invented in 1947 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Bell Labs in New York City. It uses vacuum tubes to process information instead of magic numbers and letters like earlier computers did.
