The power of creativity: What does it mean for your business?
Creativity is a key factor in any business, and it can mean the difference between success and failure. Whether you’re working on a project or just thinking out loud, creativity can help you come up with innovative solutions that solve problems. But what does it really mean for your business? Here are six things to keep in mind when looking to embrace creativity: 1. It can help you attract new customers. When people feel inspired by your work, they’re more likely to invest in your product or service. 2. It can increase productivity. Having fresh ideas on how to improve your business process can lead to faster and more efficient progress. 3. It can help you build relationships with customers. By being open and sharing your ideas, you risk losing customers who are already loyal to your competitor. 4. It can help you shift focus from results to customer satisfaction.

Concepts behind plot and story: What are the elements of a good story?
Plot is the story's backbone, and without a plot, stories are essentially empty vessels. Storytelling has been around for centuries, and there are dozens of different concepts that contribute to a good story. Here are a few key ones:
1) Characters: What makes a good character? Is he or she likable, believable, and relatable? Are they in control of their own lives and choices? Are they interesting enough to follow along with the story?

2) Plot: How does the story go from start to finish? Is it chronological, or does it go in reverse or hops around like an L.A. law student on a bender? Are there any side stories that play into the main plotline? And how important is the climax/ending to the story?
