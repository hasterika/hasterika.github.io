Invention: What are the four ways that invention happens?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea or design that is not currently existing. Invention occurs in many different ways, but four are particularly important: Creative Art, Technology, Business and Science. 
Creative Art occurs when people come up with new ideas or designs that they never would have thought of before. This can be done through brainstorming, drawing inspiration from others, or even just looking at something and thinking of potential solutions. Technology happens when scientists find new ways to make things work better and faster. Business happens when companies decide how to use their invention and create products that people will want to buy. Science happens when scientists figure out how things work and learn how to make them work better.
