The 5 Types of Ideas: Creative, Strategic, Normative, Primal, and Vague.
Creative ideas can be anything, but they typically fall into one of five types: strategic, normative, Primal, and vague. 
Strategic ideas are those that focus on the overall strategy of a project or organization. Normative ideas deal with how things should be done in order to achieve a certain result. Primal ideas are the raw materials that creative minds start with and use to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. Vague ideas are those that are too general or abstract for anyone to really understand them without more information.

Considerations when renovating or upgrading: What should you take into account when renovating or upgrading your home?
Renovating or upgrading your home can be a great way to update and improve the look and feel of your home. However, there are some important considerations you should take into account when renovating or upgrading your home. Here are a few key points to keep in mind: 
1. Use common sense when renovating or upgrading your home – don’t overdo things and wait until it’s too late. You may not be able to afford to make any necessary changes later on, and you may not have the time or resources to do so. If you wait, you could end up regretting your decision. 
2. Don’t overspend – it’s always better to initially save up money rather than spend more on unnecessary features that won’t actually improve the look or function of your home.
