The creative process: How does one go about creating something new?
Creativity is a process that some people enjoy and others find difficult. The creative process can be broken down into four main categories: 1) Brainstorming 2) Idea generation 3) Implementation 4) Delivery. In order to be creative, one must have an idea and be able to come up with creative ways to express that idea. Additionally, one must have the courage to take risks in order to create something new. Lastly, creativity can only come from within.

executed Projects: What makes a successful DIY project?
The best DIY projects are those that are executed flawlessly. There are a few key factors that make a successful project: 1) the right tools and materials; 2) a clear plan; 3) steady progress; and 4) timely communication. Here are three tips to help you create successful DIY projects:
1. Use the Right Tools and Materials
Tools play an essential role in any DIY project, but it is especially important to use the right tools for the job. Make sure you have the correct blades, saws, hammers, screws, nails, etc. If you don't have the right tools, your project will likely be more difficult and time-consuming than necessary.

2. Have A Clear Plan

Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!
