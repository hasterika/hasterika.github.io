Summary: What are some creative ideas, and how should you go about using them?
Creative ideas can be anything from simple changes to whole new directions. However, there are a few key things to keep in mind when using creative ideas. First, make sure that the idea is something that you would want to try out yourself. If it is something that you know how to do, testing it out on a small scale may be all that is needed. Second, make sure the idea has potential for being executed well. A good way to make sure this is to see if people have already come up with similar ideas or if there are any specific ways that the idea could be improved upon. Lastly, make sure that the idea has potential for success. This means seeing if it can actually be done and also seeing if people are willing to pay attention to it. Finally, remember to keep things fun!
