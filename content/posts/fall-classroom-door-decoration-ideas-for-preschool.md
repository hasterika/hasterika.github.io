Innovation processes: How does an inventor go from idea to product?
Invention processes can vary significantly depending on the inventor's background and experience. Generally, an inventor will need to generate a number of different ideas in order to come up with a product that is new and exciting. This might include generating concepts for products, working on prototypes, or even coming up with new business models.
One important factor that will affect the invention process is the inventor's willingness to risk failure. If the inventor feels that their idea is too risky or if they do not believe that it can be turned into a successful product, they will likely not go ahead with it. In addition, the inventor's skills and knowledge might also be needed in order to create a successful product.

Tips for improving the appearance of your home
Looking to improve the appearance of your home? Here are a few tips to help!
1. Make use of natural light - All homes benefit from natural light, whether they're for sleeping or working in. In order to create this light, start by using windows and doors that open freely, and then keep your curtains and window treatments open.

2. Be creative - Not all home improvement projects are created equal. If you're looking to spruce up your space with some new decorating ideas, be sure to take into account what's important to you and what you can do with minimal effort. Try focusing on details like draperies or fabrics instead of overly-large changes.

3. Use common sense - When it comes to home decoration, be aware of the pitfalls that can often lead to a less-than-appealing final product.
