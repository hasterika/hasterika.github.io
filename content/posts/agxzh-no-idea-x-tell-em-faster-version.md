Examples: When can you use creative ideas in your work?
Creative ideas are great for your work. You can use them to improve the quality of your work, or to come up with new and unique ideas. Here are a few examples:
1. Use creative ideas when you need to come up with an idea that is outside the normal. For example, you may need to come up with an idea for a story that is different from what other people have written before.

2. When you have an idea that is not very clear, try using creative ideas to help make it more clear. Such as making the idea more concise, or adding images or diagrams to help explain it better.

3. If you have a problem with something that you are working on, try using creative ideas to help solve it.

Origins of Innovation: Why do people invest in innovation?
Innovation is a term that is used to describe a range of different activities and ideas that have the potential to make a difference in someone’s life. Some of the reasons why people might invest in innovation include wanting to change the world, feeling like they can do something better than anyone else, or simply needing a new idea to try out. There are many different types of innovation, and each has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. One of the most important things to remember when considering whether or not innovation is right for you is to ask yourself what you need it for. If you don’t think you need it, then chances are it won’t be an important part of your Innovation strategy.
