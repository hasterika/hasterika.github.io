What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the activity of brainstorming. Brainstorming is an effective way to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. When done correctly, brainstroming can lead to improved business plans, strategies and operations. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when trying to achieve brainstroming success.

1) Brainstorming should be formed into teams or groups in order to provide more cohesion. This will help prevent members from working on individual projects at the same time.
2) Brainstorming should be focused on solving real-world problems rather than just coming up with new ideas. This will help your team become more knowledgeable about the problem at hand and can help you develop better solutions.

How can we come up with big ideas?
The best ideas come from a brainstorming session. Sometimes, it’s just easier to think broad thoughts when you have a lot of different ideas in your head. Here are some tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of different ideas in your head, it can be difficult to remember which ones are the most important. The best way to organize these ideas is by having a main idea and then going from there. This will help you keep track of what you’re working on and make sure that it’s always relevant to your main idea.

2. Take advantage of technology: Technology has helped us massively in the past when it comes to coming up with big ideas. By using tools like Google Earth or yellow boards, we can easily brainstorm and keep track of our thoughts as we go.
