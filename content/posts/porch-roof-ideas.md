The definition of an invention: What is it?
Inventions are creations that make things work better or easier than they would without them. They can be physical objects like a car or a computer, or intellectual property like a patent or trade secret. There are many different types of inventions, and the definition of an invention can vary depending on what you're looking for. For example, some people might define an invention as a new product, while others might focus on making something easier or more efficient. This concept is also important to understand when it comes to patenting an invention - not all inventions need to be patented in order for them to be considered an invention.

The history of brainstorming
In the late 1940s, a group of psychologists working at Yale University began to study what is now known as brainstorming. The team, led by George Prince, was interested in finding out whether people could come up with more ideas if they worked on their own or in groups.
The psychologists conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to come up with as many ideas as possible for different topics. They found that people who worked on their own came up with fewer ideas than those who worked in groups.

The psychologists also found that the quality of the ideas generated was better when people worked in groups. This is because people are able to build on each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas as a result.

The findings of the Yale study sparked a lot of interest in the idea of brainstorming and its potential benefits.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you can always count on. With the right mindset, any big idea can be turned into a successful business venture. So what are some of the most common big ideas? Here are five of the most common:
1. Start with something small. When you have a big goal in mind, it’s easier to focus on smaller steps that will make your dream a reality. This is especially true for businesses – by starting with something small, you can gradually increase your chances of achieving your larger goal.

2. Be persistent. If you want to achieve success, don’t give up until the end. Pounds saved every month will eventually lead to more money in your pocket and more customers coming through your door.
