Editing andpublishing: What steps do you take after coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be a daunting task, but it's important to first take steps to editing and publishing your ideas. Once you've created some great concepts, it's important to make sure that they're properly accessible and saleable. Here are some key steps to follow:
