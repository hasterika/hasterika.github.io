creating a plan: What steps should you take to create a plan for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that you want them to be, but there are a few key steps you should take in order to create a plan for your creative ideas. First, identify what kind of ideas you want to pursue. Once you have a solid idea of what you want to create, it’s time to start thinking about how you will go about pursuing those ideas. 
Next, think about the resources you will need in order to pursue your creative ideas. What tools and equipment do you need in order to begin working on your projects? If you don’t have any tools or equipment, it’s important to find someone who does and ask them for help. Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to start thinking about the deadline that you will be wanting your project done by.
