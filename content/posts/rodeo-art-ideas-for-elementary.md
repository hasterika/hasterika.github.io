What makes big ideas so powerful?
A big idea is an unconventional solution that can help solve a problem. It's a solution that people don't usually think of and it's something that they might not be able to come up with on their own. Big ideas are essential to innovation, creativity, and invention. By coming up with big ideas, we can change the way the world functions and create new opportunities for everyone.

Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.

What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everywhere. Whether it’s on a T-shirt, in your head, or on the internet, there are always new and innovative ways to approach problems and solve problems. 
There are many types of ideas, but here are three that stand out the most to me: 
1. The brainstorming method: This is a great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Simply take some time and brainstorm all of the different options until you have a few that you like the best.
2. The problem/solution process: This is another great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Once you have a few good ones, you can start working on solving the real world problems that they address.
