Implementation: How do we make our ideas into a reality?
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any organization. It can help a company stay ahead of the competition and make new and innovative products. However, it can be difficult to implement new ideas. There are a number of ways to make innovation a reality in your organization. 
One way is to create a culture of innovation. This means that everyone in your organization is encouraged to come up with new ideas and try out new concepts. You also need to provide support for these ideas, whether that means granting credit for invention or providing resources to help them become reality. 

Another way to implementation innovation is through process improvement. By improving the way that you do things, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to develop and/or implement new ideas. This can be done by changing processes or instituting standardized procedures.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.
