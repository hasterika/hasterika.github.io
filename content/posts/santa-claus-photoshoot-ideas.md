Decorating: How can you make your home look its best without spending a fortune?
There are many ways to decorated your home without spending a fortune. You can buy new art or accessories or make your own decorations with materials you have on hand. Here are some ideas to help you get started: 
1. Decorate the walls with art. Paint the walls in different colors and designs, add pictures, or use products like spray paint to create an ethnic look. 
2. Use pieces of furniture that are not intended for living space and put them in places that will be used often such as the hallway or bedroom. This will give your home a more finished appearance without spending a lot of money. 
3. Add plants and flowers to your home in any way possible. Not only will this add decoration, but it also makes the environment more welcoming and stress-free. 
4. Get creative with window treatments and draperies.

There is no single answer when it comes to how to get great ideas for projects. However, one approach to getting great ideas is brainstroming. Brainstroming is a process of brainstorming with a specific goal in mind. By taking a step back and asking yourself what you want your project to achieve, you can come up with more creative and efficient solutions.

The first time I tried it, I was having trouble coming up with a solution to a complex math problem. After trying brainstroming for a while, I was able to come up with the solution in under five minutes.
