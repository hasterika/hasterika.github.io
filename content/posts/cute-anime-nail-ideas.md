Patent trends: What are some of the latest patent trends?
Patents are a valuable source of intellectual property. They can protect your ideas and inventions from being copied or used without your permission. However, it's important to be aware of thelatest patent trends so you can stay ahead of any potential infringements. Here are some key points to keep in mind: 
1. Inventor protection claims are getting more common. 
2. Patent applications are coming in larger numbers, and they're more complex than ever before. 
3. The number of patents granted is also increasing, but there's still a lot of competition for the same rights and permissions. 
4. There's a growing trend of using Previously Unpublished Data (PUD) in patent applications. This allows inventors to use data that they've already filed with other companies but which they haven't been able to disclose until now.
