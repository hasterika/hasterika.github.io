What are big ideas?
There is no definitive answer to the question of what big ideas are, but they can generally be described as ideas that could have a significant impact on a person, company, or society. Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes, and it’s important to find the right ones for your business or organization. Here are five examples: 
1. Promote social responsibility: A big idea for most businesses is to promote social responsibility. This could mean donating to charity, taking a Stand for Climate Change, or Supporting Women’s Rights. 
2. Create new ways to sell products: Another big idea for businesses is to create new ways to sell their products. This could include think tanking on how best to market their product, developing innovative ad campaigns, or even testing new sales models.

Idea 1: Why did this idea come to mind?
This idea came to mind because of my son's 6th grade science project. In it, he was trying to figure out why a bee falls off of a tree. He found that the bee's wings would eventually break and they would fall to the ground. He thought this could be a fun experiment to do with his classmates.
