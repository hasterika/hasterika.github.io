Business models: What are some innovative business models?
Invention ideas can be anything from a new product to a new business model. Here are some of the most innovative business models in the world:
1. The sharing economy: This is a model where people trade goods and services for each other. It is growing rapidly, with companies like Uber and Airbnb following suit.

2. The data-collection industry: This is a model where businesses collect data about their customers in order to sell them products or services. Datacollection has become increasingly important in today’s economy, as more and more companies need to know how their customers are interacting with them.

3. The crowdfunding industry: This model takes advantage of the generosity of people who want to support a project but don’t have enough money available to do so.
