The Process of Invention: How ideas are born and developed
Invention is the process by which new ideas are born and developed. It starts with a brainstorming session, where people come up with ideas for products or services. Next, the team that will be working on developing these ideas must come up with a plan for how to make this idea a reality. This includes coming up with a concept, creating drawings, and finally making prototypes. Once these prototypes have been created, it is then important to test them to see if they are effective. If not, then the team must go back and revise their plan until they are successful.

Sometimes the best ideas come from small things. Take the example of a new restaurant concept that started in a small town in upstate New York. The owners decided to open their restaurant inside an old abandoned warehouse. The idea was to provide a unique dining experience for locals and tourists who were passing through the area. The restaurant quickly became popular, and the owners decided to open a second location in New York City.
