Ideas for big projects: How can we get started on a big project?
If you're looking for ideas for bigger projects, here are a few things to consider. First, think about what you want to accomplish. Whether it be a new home, a new car, or a renovation project, trying to come up with an idea that's both ambitious and achievable is key. Next, take into account your budget and time frame.

How to get started with big ideas?
If you're looking to start making big ideas, one of the best ways to do it is by learning how to brainstorm. A lot can be gained from practicing brainstorming, especially if you want to come up with ideas for projects or products that are both new and innovative. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 
1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself 
When brainstorming, it's important not to spend too much time just thinking about what other people might think or feel about your idea.
