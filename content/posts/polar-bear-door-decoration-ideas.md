What makes good ideas?
Ideas are a precious commodity. They can be used to inspire new possibilities, or to create something that never existed before. However, they often come with a lot of baggage. Some people may find them difficult to work with, while others may find them too difficult to discard. In order to make good ideas better, it is important to have a clear understanding of what makes them good first.

When it comes to innovation, there are a few things that always seem to set a company apart from the rest. Perhaps the most well-known example is Silicon Valley’s “technology shock,” where innovative new technologies emerged suddenly and explosively in the early 1960s. At other times, companies can be credited for developing innovative products or services over time, such as Levi Strauss and Co.'s jeans becoming popular after they were first developed in the 1800s.
