Overcoming barriers to big thinking
It's no secret that some of the world's most successful people are also some of the world's biggest thinkers. But what separates these individuals from everyone else?
For starters, they're not afraid to think big. They don't let their imaginations be limited by what's considered "normal" or "possible." Instead, they allow themselves to explore every possibility, no matter how far-fetched it may seem.

In addition to thinking big, these individuals are also willing to take risks. They know that in order to achieve something great, they may have to put everything on the line. They're not afraid of failure, because they know that even if they don't achieve their goal, they'll learn something valuable in the process.

 Finally, these individuals are persistent.

Origins of innovation: How has it been developed over time?
Innovation is a process that starts with a problem and then comes up with a creative solution to it. It is the result of creativity and the willingness to learn from your mistakes. Innovation is a key factor in economic growth, according to some experts. The history of innovation can be traced back to ancient Greece, where thinkers such as Socrates and Aristotle were fighting for ideas that would improve society. In China, the first written mention of innovation can be found in an account from the 3rd century BC written by Lu Cang. In Japan, it was only after Emperor Taishō made education compulsory in 1868 that people began to learn about innovation. In the 20th century, innovation was widely accepted by society and was considered part of the natural order of things. However, during World Wars II, there was a major shift in how innovation was viewed by both sides.
