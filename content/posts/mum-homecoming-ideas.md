Differential Pricing: What is differential pricing and how can it be used in your business?
Differential pricing is a marketing strategy that divides the market into two or more segments and pricing their products differently to encourage sales within each segment. This allows businesses to sell their products at a lower wholesale price and then sell them at a higher price to buyers in other segments. It can also be used for product differentiation, driving sales by making one product more affordable than another.

The history of invention: From ancient times to the modern day
Invention is the act of creating a new object or idea from scratch. It has been around for centuries, and some of the most iconic inventions include the wheel, the telephone, and insulin. However, there are also some less well-known inventions that have had a significant impact on our lives. For example, the condom was invented by a man named John Hargrave in 1877. He came up with the idea after seeing a group of men fighting outside his home. He realized that if he could create a device that prevented conception then he could prevent any future fights between men and prevent them from ending in bloodshed.
