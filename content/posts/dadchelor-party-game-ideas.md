The benefits of brainstorming
When it comes to generating new ideas, brainstorming is one of the most effective tools at our disposal. By bringing together a diverse group of people and encouraging them to think creatively, we can come up with solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable.
There are a number of benefits to brainstorming, including:

1. It encourages creativity: By stimulating the creative part of our brain, brainstorming can help us come up with ideas that we wouldn’t have thought of on our own.

2. It helps us find new solutions to old problems: By looking at problems from a different perspective, we can often find new and innovative solutions that we would never have thought of before.
