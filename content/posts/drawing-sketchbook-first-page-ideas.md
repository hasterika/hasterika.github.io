Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.

The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is a key component of business success. It allows businesses to change and improve their products, services and processes in order to meet customer needs. However, innovation can also be a challenge. Sometimes, businesses find it difficult to identify the best ideas for new products or services and implement them successfully. This can lead to disappointment and even failure.
One way to overcome this challenge is by taking advantage of innovative technologies. Technologies that allow businesses to quickly create new products or services are often more successful than those that require more thought or effort. For example, online tools that help businesses track customer data are often more popular than those that involve physical visits or surveys.

Banks, insurance companies and other large organizations have used online tools for years in order to keep track of their customers’ spending habits and investments.
