The Three Types of Ideas: What are they and how should you use them?
Ideas are a type of ammunition that can be used to improve a person's productivity, creativity and overall outlook. There are three main types of ideas: operational, problem-solving and innovative.
Operational ideas involve tasks that can be completed quickly and easily. These include things like fixing a car or getting the cat out of the dog's toy box. Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.
