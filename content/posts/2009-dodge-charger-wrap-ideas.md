Patenting an invention: What is the process?
Patenting an invention can be a complex process, but there are key steps that are typically followed. Inventors typically create a patent application, which is then submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The USPTO will review the application and decide whether to issue a patent or not. If the USPTO decides to issue a patent, the inventor must then file a full U.S. Patent Act lawsuit against someone who has already registered their trade mark or copyrighted their invention.
