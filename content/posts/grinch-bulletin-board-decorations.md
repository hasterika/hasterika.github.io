Conclusion: What is invention? How important is it? Why has it been so important in human history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to write and ideas have been able to spread. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or solution, which can be used to improve something that someone else has created. Inventions have helped people achieve success in a variety of fields, from technology to medicine. In recent years, however, invention has come under fire from some who argue that it is an important part of plagiarism and creativity. Though there are some merits to Invention, it is important to understand its importance before making any decisions about its use in human history.

2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.

In a world that is constantly changing and evolving, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas have the power to change the world, and they often start with just one person.

The different ways in which creativity can be used in art: To create atmosphere, mood, or story
There are numerous ways in which creativity can be used in art, from creating atmosphere to mood to story. Here are four examples:
1. Atmosphere: by adding a sense of calm or excitement, an artist can create a believable and distracting environment for the viewer to inhabit.
2. Mood: by using different colors and brushstrokes, an artist can create a range of emotions that can be manipulated through composition and color alone.
3. Storytelling: by weaving together disparate elements into one story or plot, an artist can create engaging and dimensional work that becomes both memorable and unforgettable.
