Big ideas are the foundation of any successful business. They can be anything from a new product to a new strategy. They can also be ideas that are impossible to achieve, but can still be valuable for businesses. For example, the idea of online retail could be a valuable idea for a business if it was possible to sell products without having to go into a physical store.
