The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in people’s lives. Once theirmain objective has been achieved (and often not easily), they may start thinking about other things instead of delivering on their original promise.

2. Failing to deliver on expectations: Big ideas often involve significant changes that could have a significant impact on both people and businesses if not executed flawlessly.

The benefits of invention: List the benefits of being an inventor.
1. Invention brings about change. This change can be positive or negative, but it is always worth considering the potential outcomes of an invention before deciding whether or not to pursue it.
2. Inventors have the opportunity to make a significant impact on the world around them. Their inventions can improve the quality of life for people in their community or even across the globe.

3. Being an inventor also comes with a certain amount of prestige and respect from others. Inventors are often looked up to as creative problem-solvers who are able to see things in a different way than most people.
