1. Make a list of things you want to do. This will help you remember what you want to think about and start thinking about how to do it.
2. Take on small projects. smallest tasks can lead to the most productive ideas because they are manageable and don’t require a lot of time or resources.
3. Be open to new ideas. If you aren’t constantly being pulled in new directions, your brain will start losing its knack for creativity and innovation.
4. Don’t be afraid to ask others for help with your idea collection or brainstorming process.
