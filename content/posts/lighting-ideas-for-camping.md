motion picture technology: What were some of the advances?
Invention ideas for motion picture technology include new ways to create realistic graphics and sound, and more efficient filming techniques. Some of the advances that have been made in this field include: 
- Virtual reality: In a recent study, virtual reality headsets were used to film a movie set in another world. The experience was incredibly realistic, and allowed for a much deeper level of immersion than traditional movies.

- Augmented reality: This technology uses computer software to project digital images onto real or other surfaces. These images can be used to help actors perform scenes more accurately, or even provide clues about the story itself.
