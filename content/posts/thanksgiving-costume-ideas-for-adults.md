Definition of a big idea: What are the consequences of considering something?
Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:
1. A big idea is an innovative solution to a problem that has yet to be solved.

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.
