Introduce the topic of invention ideas
Most people never think about invention ideas until they see a commercial for a new product on television. Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market. The process of invention is one that takes a lot of time, energy and dedication. Inventors are some of the most creative people in the world. They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.

Summary: What are the benefits of having more ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any creative business. They can change how you think and how you operate, giving your business the power to succeed. But what are the benefits of having more ideas? Here are five key ones:
1. You can be more productive. When you have more ideas, you're less likely to get bogged down in a same-old routine and therefore have more time to complete projects.
2. You can be more innovative. By having more ideas, you're less likely to follow someone else's plan and get stuck with something that's not working.
3. You can be better organized. Having lots of ideas means being able to see things from a different perspective and then coming up with a plan for dealing with those perspectives in order to make things work well together.
4. You can be cheaper and faster than ever before.
