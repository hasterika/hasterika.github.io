Contributions of invention: What has been done with invention that has changed the world?
Invention has had a profound impact on the world, from the creation of dishes that could be made without cookbooks to modern surgical tools and vehicles. Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:

2) Invention of combustion engine in 1879 by John Fenton and Arthur Couch. This allowed cars to be driven on paved roads instead of being pulled by horses or carts.

Basic Tips for Doing a Better Job: Be sure to follow these Basic Tips before starting any DIY project, and you'll get the job done right.
If you're looking to improve your DIY skills, there are a few things you should keep in mind before beginning any project. Here are some basic tips to help you get started: 
1) Follow the instructions thoroughly - if something isn't working correctly, take it to someone who knows more about it than you do. This will help prevent any surprises down the line and make sure your project is completed on time and without incident. 

2) Have a plan - once you've got the basics down, it's important to create a plan for how you'll go about completing your project. This will help ensure that everything goes as planned and that nothing gets lost in the process. 

3) Be organized - when trying to complete a project by yourself, it can be helpful to have a list of supplies and items involved.
