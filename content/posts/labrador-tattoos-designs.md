How To Come Up With Ideas: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to help something else become a reality. Whether it’s coming up with a new product idea or coming up with a plan to improve something you’re working on, creativity is essential to any successful project. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 1. Take your time – Don’t try to come up with an idea right away.

Invention: How does innovation happen?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new way to do something. Sometimes, this comes about through the sharing of ideas or the discovery of a new resource. Sometimes, it comes about through the development of a new product or service.
In any case, innovation happens in many ways and at different speeds. Here are four examples that illustrate how: 

1) Invention often happens spontaneously - people will often come up with ideas for new products or services while they are still working on other projects. 
2) Invention can be slow - sometimes it takes years for someone to develop a new product or service that is really useful. 
3) Invention can be fast - sometimes people can come up with ideas for products and services in minutes or even seconds.
