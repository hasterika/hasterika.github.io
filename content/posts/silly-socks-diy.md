What is the creation process like?
Invention ideas are something that often come to people by surprises. They may be something that someone has been thinking about, or something that they were inspired by. The creation process is a crucial part of any invention, and can play a major role in how successful the invention is. There are many different steps involved in the creation process, and each one has its own importance. 
The first step is always brainstorming. This can be done either before or after the idea has been finalized. It is important to get rid of any bad ideas before they become a part of the product. This will help to make sure that the product is truly unique and innovative. Once an idea has been brainstormed, it needs to be tested. This can be done in many ways, but the most important part is to find a way that the product can be used in reality.

Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.

Ideas are what weasel out of hard decisions. They're the alternative that we can't think of or the solution that's too complicated or risky. We're drawn to them because they seem like a way out, but often they're just a way to avoid responsibility. As our world becomes more complex, it's more important than ever to come up with solutions and be relentless in seeking new ideas.

What is an invention?: Define what an invention is.
An invention is a new device, method, or process that solves a problem or improves upon an existing one. Inventions can be as simple as a new way to open a door or as complex as a new computer system. The key to any invention is that it must offer some improvements over existing solutions.
