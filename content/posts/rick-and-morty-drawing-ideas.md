nexpected Ways to Generate Ideas:
Big ideas are the seeds of change that can have a significant impact on society and businesses. By constantly thinking about new, innovative ways to solve problems and create value, companies and societies can rise to new heights. Here are 7 possible ways to generate big ideas: 1. Think outside the box: when it comes to problem-solving, there’s no limit to what you can imagine. come up with concepts or products that have never been thought of before. Even if your idea is nothing more than a wild guess, it still could be the next big thing. 2. Rethink how you do things: changes in business or society often come about through innovations in how we do things rather than from scratch. How we organize our work space, how we communicate with customers, how we pay employees – all of these factors play into how our businesses operate.
