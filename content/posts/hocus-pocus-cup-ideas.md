How to have more creative ideas: methods for improving your creativity
If you're looking for ways to be more creative, try these methods:
1. Get organized. This may seem counter-intuitive, but being organized can actually help you be more creative. When everything is in its place, you can focus your energy on generating new ideas instead of wasting time looking for things.

2. Take breaks. Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to take a break from whatever you're working on. Go for a walk, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. You may be surprised at how refreshed and ready to think creatively you feel when you return to your project.

Aesthetic preferences: What kind of things make someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors?
Creative endeavors can be both rewarding and challenging, but they always include some form of art. Whether it's the creation of beautiful paintings or the designing of innovative new technologies, artists are always working to improve their skills. One important aspect of artistic excellence is aesthetics, which refers to the way a person looks. There are a variety of factors that can influence an artist's appearance, and many people have different preferences when it comes to what makes someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors. Some people prefer simple, unadorned designs while others enjoy colorful and intricate pieces. Some people like their artwork to be popular and flashy while others prefer more introspective pieces that will get them noticed. However, there is no one definitive way that artists look good or bad in their work. It ultimately depends on how they approach their art and how they feel about themselves as individuals.
