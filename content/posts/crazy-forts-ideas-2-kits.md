The history and definition of creative art: From the ancient Greeks to the 20th century
There is no one definition of creative art that can encompass everything that may be considered creative. However, the term “creative” has been used to refer to various activities throughout history. From ancient Greeks to the 20th century, there have been many different definitions of what creativity means.
