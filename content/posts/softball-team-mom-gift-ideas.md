Conclusion: What are the implications of innovation for business?
Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.

A few Tips for Using Brainstroming to Improve Your Life
Brainstroming can help improve your thinking and productivity, especially if you're struggling with a specific problem or goal. Here are a few tips for using brainstroming to get started: 
1. Get organized: Brainstroming can help you focus on one task at a time, which can make it easier to succeed at your goal. Keep track of your thoughts and ideas in an easily accessible place, and use that information to jumpstart your brainstorming process. 

2. Take some time for yourself: Brainstorming is a great way to clear your head and come up with new ideas. However, don't work on your project for hours on end – set some limits and let the brainstorming process take its course.

Creative art can be both therapeutic and functional.

The 4 types of creativity: Intrinsic, extrinsic, creative accident, and creative process.
Creative process is the sum total of all the steps that go into producing a work of art. Intrinsic creativity comes from within; extrinsic creativity is based on external factors, such as the environment or the people around someone. Creative accidents happen when something goes wrong while trying to create something, usually resulting in a new and different way of looking at things. The creative process is a never-ending journey, and it can be unpredictable.
