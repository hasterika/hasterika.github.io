The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.

Idea 1: Why did this idea come to mind?
This idea came to mind because of my son's 6th grade science project. In it, he was trying to figure out why a bee falls off of a tree. He found that the bee's wings would eventually break and they would fall to the ground. He thought this could be a fun experiment to do with his classmates.
