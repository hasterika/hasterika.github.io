Trends in mobility: How is mobile technology affecting business and how will it impact the future of work?
Mobile technology is slowly but surely affecting business as more and more people move around the world. This has a big impact on the future of work, as businesses have to adapt to the needs of their customers who are increasingly using mobile devices for work purposes. Here are some ideas for how mobile technology will affect business in 2022:
1) The rise in mobile phone ownership: In 2020, over 50% of Australians had a mobile phone, up from just 25% in 2009. This has led to a big increase in the demand for data and voice services. As people becomemore reliant on their phones for work purposes, companies need to be prepared to offer good deals on data and voice rates.

2) The shift towards digital working: Technology has been gradually getting better at letting people collaborate through electronic means.

Trends in technology: How will new technologies impact the way we live and work?
Technology has always been a part of our lives, but this is especially true in the 21st century. New technologies are causing great change in how we live and work, and some of the biggest changes are coming from artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.
Both AI and Robotics have the potential to completely change the way we live and work. Here are five reasons why:

1. Artificial intelligence will improve your productivity: AI can help you make better decisions faster, which will mean you can spend more time on tasks that matter. This is especially important if you want to achieve your goals as a businessperson or individual.

2. Robotics will help you work more safely: Robotics are making it easier for us to do different jobs at home, such as caring for our elderly or pet owners.
