Invention Ideas: How can they be put into practice?
Invention ideas can be put into practice in a number of ways. Some are more complicated than others, but all of them have the potential to make a big impact. Here are five possible ways: 
1. Use technology to create new products or services. This could take the form of developing new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, building virtual reality headsets or creating 3D printing coral reef models.
2. Use renewable energy sources to generate electricity from the sun or wind resources. This could involve developing solar panels, wind turbines or electric vehicles that run on diesel or gasoline instead of gasoline or oil. 
3. Use natural materials to make products or services more sustainable and environmentally friendly. These could include using bamboo for furniture, using recycled materials for insulation or recycling plastic bottles into water bottles and cups. 
4. Use recycled materials in new products or services.

Conclusion: Some ways to come up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas are aplenty, but sometimes they don't come easy. You have to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things. Here are some ways to come up with creative ideas: 
1. Take on a new project: This can be something as small as creating a new design for your business cards or as large as starting your own business. It doesn't have to be anything that you're exclusively good at – it could be something that you're curious about and haven't tried before. Everything counts! 
2. Lead an experiment: One of the best ways to come up with creative ideas is to lead an experiment. This means starting off by thinking about what you're not doing and trying something different instead.
