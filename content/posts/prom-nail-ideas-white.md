What are the benefits of big ideas?
Big ideas can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and help you come up with new ideas. There are a number of benefits to big ideas, including increase productivity, increased creativity, and more efficient thinking. Here are four examples:
1. Big ideas can lead to new solutions to old problems. When you have a big idea, you can start by thinking about what other people have already tried and found successful. This will give you new insights that could solve the problem at hand.

2. Big ideas can free up time for you to focus on your own work instead of others’ work. When you have a lot of big ideas in your head, it can be difficult to focus on your own projects. Instead of struggling with each one, working on a few big ones will free up time for you to achieve the rest of your goals.
