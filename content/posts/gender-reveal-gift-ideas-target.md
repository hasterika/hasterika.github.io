Invention is the process of creating something new, whether that be a product or a design. For many people, invention is an important part of their life, and for good reason: inventions can make lives better. For example, in 1863, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed the first practicable Telegraph Machine. This machine allowed for the transmission of messages without the use of horses or riders.
