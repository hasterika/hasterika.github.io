Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future? Once you have an idea for a problem, it’s time to start coming up with ways to solve it. Finally, think about how you might approach solving the problem. Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?

Idea #2: Get inspiration from other cultures or websites
Inspiration can be found in many places, including websites and cultures. If you are looking to get your ideas for new designs or products from other sources, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, take into account the tone of the website or culture you are looking to emulate. If it is lighthearted and fun, then copying that style will likely be successful. However, if the website or culture is moreserious or educational, then it is important to think about what type of ideas could be included on the site or product. Additionally, think about what type of message the site or culture wants to send. If you want to copy their style but add your own unique spin on it, make sure to do so in a way that is enticing and relevant to the target audience. Finally, always remember that inspiration comes from everywhere and not just from specific websites or cultures.
