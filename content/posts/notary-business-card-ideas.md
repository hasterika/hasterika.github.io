When your invention is accepted, it can be a huge feeling. It's a sign that you've made something that people will want and use. But there are a few things to keep in mind if your invention is accepted.

Second, make sure you're doing everything you can to promote your invention. This might include creating buzz around it, making yourself available to answer any questions people have, or writing articles about your invention to help spread the word. 
Finally, be prepared for the financial challenges that come with being an inventor. This might mean having to find investors or selling your idea rights in order to get started on developing it commercially.
