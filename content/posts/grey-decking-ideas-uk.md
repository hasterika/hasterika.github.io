Invention: What are the four ways that invention happens?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea or design that is not currently existing. Invention occurs in many different ways, but four are particularly important: Creative Art, Technology, Business and Science. 
Creative Art occurs when people come up with new ideas or designs that they never would have thought of before. This can be done through brainstorming, drawing inspiration from others, or even just looking at something and thinking of potential solutions. Technology happens when scientists find new ways to make things work better and faster. Business happens when companies decide how to use their invention and create products that people will want to buy. Science happens when scientists figure out how things work and learn how to make them work better.

Ideas that work: Why do some ideas work and others don't?
Creative ideas are often the most successful, but it can be tough to know why. Here are four reasons:
1. You have to be willing to try something.
2. What you think is working may not be working for others, so you have to come up with a new idea that does what they want and works for you.
3. Your idea might not be original, but it's more likely to work because it's been tried before or because someone else has already created a similar product or service that people are using and liking.
4. Your idea might be better than what's currently out there, so give your stuff a go and see whether it works or not – even if it doesn't quite fit the mold of what everyoneelse is doing!
