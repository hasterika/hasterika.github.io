Why and how do people come up with new invention ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, both within and outside of the inventor themselves. Sometimes, an idea is sparked by something that the inventor sees or hears. Other times, someone else has an idea that the inventor thinks could be improved. In either case, it is important to find out why the inventor came up with the idea in the first place and how they went about making it a reality.

Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you don’t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what you’re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, it’s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they aren’t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.
