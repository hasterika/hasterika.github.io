Creativity in art: How can it be used?
Creativity in art can be used in a variety of ways, from creating new and original pieces to exploring old ideas and techniques. There are a number of different methods that creative artists use to express themselves, and it ultimately depends on what the artist is looking for. Some common ways to utilize creativity in art include:
1. Drawing inspiration from nature – often times, artists will take inspiration from things that they see around them or feel inside themselves. This can involve looking at photos or drawings as a way to start thinking about how they could create a piece based on what they see.

2. Experimenting with materials and techniques – many times, creative artists will try out new materials or techniques in order to see what works best for them.
