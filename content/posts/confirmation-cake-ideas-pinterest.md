Take flight!: Are there any other ways you can use your creativity to help solve problems?
Creativity can be used in a number of ways to solve problems. One way is to come up with big ideas. Big ideas are solutions that are large enough to be accomplished, but small enough that they can be implemented. There are many ways to come up with big ideas, so it is important to find the one that works best for you. Some ways to find big ideas include: 
1) thinking out loud – When you have a lot of ideas racing through your head, it can be helpful to take a break and talk about some of them with someone else. This will help you focus on what you want to achieve and avoid getting lost in your thoughts. 
2) brainstorming – This process helps you come up with multiple solutions at the same time and then put them all together to see which one might work best.

The role of invention in society: What are the biggest uses for innovation in society today?
Innovation has long been a key component of society. From the development of new technology to the improvement of food production, innovation has always been essential in order to keep society running smoothly and ensuring that everyone has access to the basics. 
However, there are a number of other spheres in which innovation can be used in society. For example, innovations in healthcare could lead to better treatments for patients and lessened costs; or innovations in transportation could make it easier for people to reach their destinations safely and efficiently. 

There is no one answer to whether or not innovation is important in society, but it is worth looking at how it can be used in different ways in order to ensure that everyone benefits from its impact.
