Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.

The Future of Invention: There is an active field of research that is exploring the potential of new technologies and how they could impact future generations.
Innovation is a constantly occurring event in the life of humans and technology. It has been a driving force in human progress for centuries and will continue to do so into the future. There are a number of potential new technologies that could have a significant impact on society and the economy. 
One potential technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we do business is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is able to learn and grow on its own, making it more efficient and accurate at performing tasks. This could have a significant impact on businesses, as it would make it easier to automate processes and reduce costs. 

Another potential technology that has the potential to have a significant impact on society is blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure transactions between parties without middlemen. This could have implications for many industries, including business, finance, and law.
