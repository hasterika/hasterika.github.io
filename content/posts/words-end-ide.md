Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether youâ€™re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.
