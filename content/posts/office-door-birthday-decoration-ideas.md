What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are powerful things. They can open up new thoughts, possibilities, and ways to approach problems. They can also help you focus on the right things and get productive work done.
But there are a few key benefits of having ideas that can make them even more powerful: 1) you may be able to come up with new solutions faster; and 2) you may be able to turn your brainstorming into a real project if you put in the effort.

So how do you use ideas to their full potential? Here are three tips: 
1) Make sure you have a good idea of what you want your product or service to do before starting any brainstorming process. This will give you a better understanding of what kind of problems or solutions you could consider. 
2) Be prepared to change your mind as often as needed during the brainstorming process.

How to come up with a good big idea: How do you assess whether it’s a good or bad idea?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things you can look for. First, is the idea itself? Is it something that could actually work or is it just a pipe dream? If the idea isn’t something you see everyday, it might not be as good of an idea. Next, is the feasibility of the idea? Is it something that could actually happen or is it something you think will only take a while to come up with? Lastly, do you have a clear vision for what the idea should be? Once you have all these things in mind, it’s time toevaluate whether or not the idea is a good one.
