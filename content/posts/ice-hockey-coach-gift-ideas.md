What is creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ways to solve a problem. It can be used in business, creative writing, and more. There are many creative ideas out there that you can use to improve your life or your business. Here are 8 of the most common creative thinking techniques:
1. Problem-solving: When you come up with an idea for a product or service, it’s important to have a clear problem that you can solve. This allows you to think outside the box and come up with a solution that’s novel and unique.

2. Hypothesis: Once you have a problem to solve, it’s important to generate several ideas on how to solve it. By doing this, you get a better understanding of what the problem is, as well as where potential solutions might lead.
