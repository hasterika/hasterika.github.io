How to use brainstroming in your work life?
If you're looking to use brainstroming to improve your work life, here are a few tips:
1. Make sure you have a clear and concise goal. Brainstroming without a goal can be difficult and time-consuming.

2. Get organized. When you have a well-defined goal, it's easier to stay on track and achieve it.

3. Take time for yourself. When you're working on something that interests you, taking the time to relax and enjoy yourself can go a long way in helping you reach your goals.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are always something to think about and consider as you go about your day-to-day life. Whether it’s coming up with a new idea for a product or service, or thinking of ways to make your business more efficient, big ideas are always important to consider. Here are some of the most popular big ideas around these days:
1. Start your own business: This is an option that many people take on because they feel like they don’t have a lot of options available to them. The cost of starting your own business can be low, and there are many resources available online if you need help getting started. There is also the added benefit of not having anyone else telling you what to do.

Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.
