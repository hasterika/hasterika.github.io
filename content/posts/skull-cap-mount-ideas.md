Renovating or upgrading your home can seem daunting, but with some easy diy ideas and a bit of creativity, it can be a breeze. Here are five top priorities when renovating or upgrading: 
1. Choose the right renovation project: The first step is to choose the right renovation project for your needs. Do you want to update your home for its next generation or restore it to its former glory? There are many options and consequences to each decision, so consult with a professional before starting any renovation. 
2. Get pre-approved: Once you've chosen the project you want to undertake, it's time to get pre-approved from your local building authority or other approvals required for the type of renovation you want to do. This way, you'll know exactly what permits and regulations will be necessary in order to complete the project without any surprises later on.

History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.
