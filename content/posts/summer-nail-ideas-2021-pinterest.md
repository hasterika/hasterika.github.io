The process starts with identifying the main thoughts in your mind and then sorting them into piles or groups. From there, you can start to work on one or more specific tasks based on what you’ve assigned to those thoughts.

The need for innovation
In the business world, the one thing that is always constant is change. In order to stay ahead of the competition, businesses need to be constantly innovating. They need to be looking for new ways to do things, new products to sell, and new services to offer.
Innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas, it’s about implementing those ideas and making them a reality. It’s about taking risks and being willing to fail. It’s about being able to think outside the box and challenge the status quo.

If businesses want to stay relevant and competitive, they need to embrace innovation. It’s no longer an option, it’s a necessity.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.
