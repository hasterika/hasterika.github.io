3) Creative artists often use more movement than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on stills and images to create their pieces.

The Benefits of Home Improvement: Why is it so important to maintain a good home?
Home improvement is one of the most important things you can do for your home. It can make it look better, smell better, and feel better. There are many benefits to keeping your home in good condition, including reducing your exposure to crime and improving the quality of your life. Here are six reasons why you should keep your home in good condition: 
1. Home improvement can improve the security of your home. When you keep your home in good condition, criminals are less likely to break into it and try to rob you or damage it. 
2. Home improvement can improve the quality of your environment. Your home is a place where you relax, cook meals, play games, and watch TV. By maintaining its existing elements and adding new ones, such as a garden or workout room, you can create an environment that is both comfortable and stimulating.
