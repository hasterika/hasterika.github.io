What are the top Ideas for 2022?
Looking to 2020, some potential ideas for the year 2022 include: 
1) In order to increase youth engagement with politics and policy, the government should provide more opportunities for marginalized groups like youth of color and low-income families to participate in civic engagement. 
2) To create an engaged electorate, the government could invest in marketing and public education campaigns that promote informed voting. 
3) To promote economic growth and create jobs, the government should focus on initiatives like issuing tax breaks and investing in renewable energy sources. 
4) To improve quality of life for residents, the government should focus on issues like affordable housing, accessible education, health care access, and green infrastructure. 
5) To keep up with changing technology trends, the government could consider promoting early childhood development programming and offering free or reduced-cost online courses.

Bringing Your Invention to Market: Tips on how to get your invention into the hands of consumers.
Inventing something is only half the battle. The other half is getting it out there in front of consumers. Here are a few tips on how to get your invention into the hands of people who will use it.
1. Do your research. Make sure your invention is novel and has a marketable purpose. There's no point in trying to sell something that no one wants or needs.

2. Develop a prototype. This will help you to not only test your invention, but also show it to potential manufacturers, retailers, or investors.

3. Get a patent. This will give you legal protection and help you to commercialize your invention by licensing it to others.

4. Market your invention.

What is brainstroming?
There is no one definitive definition of brainstroming, but what is generally understood is that it is a type of mental focus or concentration that can be achieved through various means. Brainstroming can be achieved through thought processes, visualization exercises, and deep focus on a single task. In some cases, it may also be used as a form of self-care. While brainstroming has many benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks that should be considered before incorporating the practice into your daily routine.

The history of invention: How have some inventions been used and what benefits have they brought?
Invention ideas are a core part of the history of technology. From ancient times to the present, people have come up with new ways to do things. Some inventions have been helpful and others have not. The history of invention is full of examples of both. Here are three examples:
The incandescent light bulb was first invented in 1879 by Jewish inventor Samuel Morse. It used a filament that was heated by an oven to create light.

The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Phonograph Company president Edward Emmons and his brother George. They created a machine that could play sound files on a screen.

The modern computer was invented in 1947 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Bell Labs in New York City. It uses vacuum tubes to process information instead of magic numbers and letters like earlier computers did.
