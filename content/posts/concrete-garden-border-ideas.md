Early Inventors and Inventions
Invention is a process of putting new ideas or objects into use. Inventions are often born out of necessity, as people try to solve everyday problems. But some inventions are created simply for the sake of novelty or fun. Early inventors made many important contributions to society, developing useful technologies that we still use today.
Some of the earliest known inventors include the Ancient Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria, who created the first steam engine, and Ctesibius, who invented the first water pump. In China, inventors developed paper and gunpowder in the 9th century. These inventions would have a profound impact on the world.

The Industrial Revolution saw a wave of new inventions that changed the way we live and work. Among these were the spinning jenny, which revolutionized textile production, and the steam engine, which powered factories and transportation.

Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
