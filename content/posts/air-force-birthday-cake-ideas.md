Invention is the process of designing, creating, and applying a new solution to a problem. It is a process that includes many steps, from identifying a need or opportunity, to generating ideas, to testing and refining prototypes. Invention is often driven by necessity, but it can also be sparked by curiosity or a desire to improve upon existing solutions. Whether driven by necessity or curiosity, invention requires creative thinking, perseverance, and often a willingness to fail.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.
