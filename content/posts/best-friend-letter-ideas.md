The role of invention in society: What are the biggest uses for innovation in society today?
Innovation has long been a key component of society. From the development of new technology to the improvement of food production, innovation has always been essential in order to keep society running smoothly and ensuring that everyone has access to the basics. 
However, there are a number of other spheres in which innovation can be used in society.
