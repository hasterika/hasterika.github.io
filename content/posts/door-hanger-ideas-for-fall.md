What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from designing a cake to making a new movie. However, some of the most creative ideas come when people combine their creativity and ingenuity. For example, one person might come up with the idea of creating three-dimensional cardboard models of buildings. Another might come up with the idea of creating an artificial intelligence that can learn and innovate based on its experiences.

Conclusion
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First, don’t worry about coming up with the “right” answer. There is no such thing when you’re brainstorming. The whole point is to come up with as many ideas as possible, even if they’re not all good. Second, allow yourself to think outside the box. The best ideas often come from thinking in a way that you wouldn’t normally. And finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Brainstorming with someone else can give you some great new perspectives on an issue.
