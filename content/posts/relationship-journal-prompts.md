Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future?
