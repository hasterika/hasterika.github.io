Creative expression: The creative act and the creative media
Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individual’s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.

Conclusion
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First, don’t worry about coming up with the “right” answer. There is no such thing when you’re brainstorming. The whole point is to come up with as many ideas as possible, even if they’re not all good. Second, allow yourself to think outside the box. The best ideas often come from thinking in a way that you wouldn’t normally. And finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Brainstorming with someone else can give you some great new perspectives on an issue.

What to include in your blog:
Blogging can be a fun and rewarding way to share your thoughts, experiences, and ideas with the world. However, not all bloggers have everything they need in their blog to make it successful. Some bloggers may lack important pieces of equipment or content that can damage their blog's popularity and cause them to lose traffic and followers. Here are some tips on what to include in your blog so that you can achieve great success:
1. Make Your Blog Name glaringly obvious: The first thing most people will notice when they visit your blog is the name. This should be the first thing you focus on making sure is correctly spelled and easily remembered. If you cannot remember your blog's name, it will likely suffer from low popularity and fewer visitors.
