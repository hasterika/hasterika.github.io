How to come up with new invention ideas: What are some steps to take when coming up with new invention ideas?
inventions are constantly being made and updated, so it's important to come up with new ideas for them as often as possible. Here are some steps to take when coming up with new invention ideas:
1. Determine what you want your invention to do. This can be difficult, but it's important to think about the potential benefits of your product or service before beginning development.

2. Consider who would be interested in your product or service. What are the key demographics that your target market might include?

3. Come up with a business plan and marketing strategy that will make your product or service available to as many people as possible. This will require scratchbuilding and/or some creativity - but it's important to have a plan in place if you want to make your idea a reality.
