Types of creativity:
Creativity is an act of thinking outside the box. It's the ability to come up with new ideas and solutions that don't always follow traditional procedures. 
There are many different types of creativity, but some are more common than others. Below are four examples of types of creativity that should be familiar to anyone who has ever tried them: 

1) brainstorming - This is when people come up with new ideas by brainstorming, which is where groups of people work together to come up with a solution.
2) problem solving - This is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem. It can be something as simple as fixing a car or solving a complex math problem.
3) creative visualization - This is when someone creates pictures or videos that help them think harder about how they want their product or project to look.

What are some creative ideas?
There are endless creative ideas to come up with, and the best way to find them is by brainstorming with a group of people. Here are eight creative ways to spark your imagination: 
1. Start a blog and write about anything that crosses your mind. This can be your personal thoughts or something you read in the news. You don’t have to be perfect – just share what’s on your mind!

2. Draw inspiration from nature and start painting scenes from around town or in your backyard. Add some animal characters for added fun!

3. Get organized and make a list of all the things you want to do before you die (or at least before you retire). Once you have a complete list, it will be easier to prioritize what’s most important.
