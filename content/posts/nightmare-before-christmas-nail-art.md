What is brainstroming?
There is no one specific definition for brainstroming, but the phenomenon is typically defined as a state of high stress and anxiety caused by a combination of external factors (such as social media) and internal factors (such as personal thoughts or feelings). Brainstroming can be described as an intense feeling of focus, productivity, and clarity. It can be a great force for turning around projects and getting things done. However, it can also lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. There are a few key steps you can take to reduce or avoid brainstroming: understand your triggers, set goals, and stay organized.

What is the young adult book industry like today?
The young adult book industry is changing rapidly, and there are a number of different ways that it is doing so. One way that the industry is changing is in terms of how books are being published. 
Before, books were published as e-books and mailed to customers. This method allowed for less editing and revision, which made the books more straightforward to read. However, this type of publishing has been gradually replaced by the electronic book format. 

The electronic book format allows for a much wider range of content to be included in a book, making it more diverse and vibrant than ever before. Additionally, this format eliminates the need for physical copies of books, which makes them more cost-effective. 

As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see what new ways it comes up with to keep readers engaged and invested in its products.
