Conclusion: the importance of creativity in our lives
When it comes to creativity, we often think of artistic pursuits like painting or writing.  However, creativity is so much more than that. It’s about thinking outside the box, coming up with new ideas and solutions, and looking at the world in a different way.
In our fast-paced, constantly changing world, creativity is more important than ever. We need to be able to adapt and come up with new ideas to solve problems. If we get stuck in the same way of thinking, we’ll never progress.

This can be done individually or in a group setting. When brainstorming, it is important to not judge or critique ideas, but simply to come up with as many ideas as possible. Once you have a list of ideas, you can then start to narrow down and choose the best ones.
