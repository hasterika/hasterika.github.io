What to do with ideas: From brainstorming to taking them to market
Ideas are like stars in a sky. They can bring light to a dark room or help you turn a negative into a positive. However, like most things in life, they come with baggage. Sometimes the baggage is good, and other times it’s bad. Here are four tips for dealing with ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas 
No one ever has all the answers to every question or problem. “Open your mind” and let new ideas flow in. Even if they don’t work out, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from them. 
2. Take the time to study what worked before 
Studying what others have done can help you develop your own idea without feeling bound by former solutions or failures.

Memory exercise: How can we improve our memory and concentration?
Memory is an important skill that we can use to improve our concentration and memory. Here are some ways to improve our memory:
1. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods help to create a strong immune system and keep our brains healthy.

2. Get enough exercise. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function and mental clarity.

3. Use brain teasers or mental puzzles to keep your mind active and engaged. Brain teasing tasks include things like finding the pattern in a jumble of numbers, solving complex math problems, or making decision trees.

4. Practice gratitude every day for all the good in our lives. Gratitude can boost mood, focus, and creativity; it can also help us remember positive experiences from past times.
