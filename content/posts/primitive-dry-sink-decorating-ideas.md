Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.
