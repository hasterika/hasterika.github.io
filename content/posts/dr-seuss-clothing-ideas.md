How to have big ideas
The ability to have big ideas is a skill that can be learned and cultivated. Here are some tips on how to have big ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas and perspectives. Don't be afraid to explore different viewpoints and challenge your own assumptions.

2. Pay attention to your surroundings and the world around you. Look for patterns and connections that you may not have noticed before.

3. Be willing to take risks. Big ideas often come from thinking outside the box and taking risks. So don't be afraid to try something new or different.

4. Be persistent and never give up. Many great ideas come after many failed attempts. So keep trying and never give up on your dreams or goals.

5. Surround yourself with other creative people.

What are some new ideas that you came up with?
In the world of technology, there are a number of new ideas that come up constantly. Some of these ideas may be more innovative than others, but all of them have the potential to make a big impact on the way we live our lives. Here are a few examples:
1. The use of Blockchain technology: This technology is very similar to Bitcoin, but instead of using cryptography to secure transactions, Blockchain uses code that is kept track of and can be verified by other computers. This allows for secure and transparent transactions, which is why it has become so popular in recent years.

2. The use of AI*: This technology is quickly becoming one of the most important aspects of modern life. AI has been used in a variety of ways over the years, but its potential as an employer or strategist has yet to be fully realized.

The process: How do you go about brainstorming ideas?
brainstorming ideas can be a fun and quick way to come up with new ideas, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind in order to create the best brainstorming experience. First, make sure that you have some idea of what you want your brainstorming session to be about. If you don't know what you want your meeting to become, it's probably not going to be as productive. Additionally, it's important that everyone is on the same page when it comes time for the brainstorming process. If one person starts talking and then somebody else joins in, it's difficult to continue getting productive ideas out of the group. Finally, make sure that everyone has their own space in which they can work without feeling crowded or interrupted.
