Most people would say that ideas are what give life its purpose. However, for some, ideas are what keep them up at night. For example, one person might have an idea for a new product, but never have the time or the energy to make it a reality. Others might have an idea for a new project, but feel too shy or scared to go ahead with it. Whatever the case may be, ideas are what make us human and keep us on our toes.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.
