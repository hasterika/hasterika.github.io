Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other concepts?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and different from what has been done before. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new product, service, or idea that is better than what was available before. Innovation can be found in everything from fashion to technology to business.
If you think about it, innovation is pretty much just a way to make things better. After all, if there was nothing new or different out there to work with, how would anyone ever come up with a new idea? In fact, innovation often comes from coming up with an idea that nobody else has thought of before. So while it may seem like a pretty big responsibility, it's actually quite easy to get started on when you have some basic ideas about what you're looking for.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that wasn't already in existence. Invention often takes place in the form of a new idea, design, or technology. It can also come from scratch, during the development of a new product. Many inventions are made for commercial reasons, such as making a new product that is more affordable or easier to use. However, many inventions are also made for personal reasons, such as creating a new way to do something.

The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.

How can you come up with big ideas?
Big ideas are important when it comes to coming up with new ideas, but they can also be a challenge. There are a few things you can do to help come up with big ideas that will be successful. The first thing is to think about what you want your idea to achieve. Once you know what your idea is, you can start thinking about how you can make it a reality. Next, take into account the competition. If there are others who have similar ideas, it will be more difficult for them to come up with a better solution than yours. Finally, make sure your idea is feasible. This means that it should not be too much trouble for people to implement your idea, and it should not require too much money or time.
