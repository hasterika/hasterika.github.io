Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative.

A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.
