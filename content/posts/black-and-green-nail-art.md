The consequences of having big ideas?
Many people believe that having big ideas is essential to creativity and innovation. However, the consequences of having big ideas can be very costly and time-consuming. For example, a company may spend years developing a new product but if its idea is not accepted by the market, the company may lose its revenue and potential customers. Additionally, it can be difficult to find backers for big projects and even harder to get the word out about them.

Innovation: How can you use innovation to create new products or services?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. It can be used to create new products or services, but it can also be used to improve existing ones. There are a number of ways to use innovation to create new products or services, and each one has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Here are some tips on how you can use innovation to create new products or services: 
1. Try out different ideas and prototypes before launch. This will help you measure whether your product or service is working as expected and find any potential issues early on. 
2. Be open to feedback and change. When trying out different ideas, be open to what other people have to say about them. This will help you develop a better understanding of your product or service and the user experience.
