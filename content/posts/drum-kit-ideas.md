What needs to be done to protect our environment?
It is now time for our society to take steps in order to protect our environment. Some ideas that could be put into place include the following:
In order to reduce the amount of plastic that is produced, it would be beneficial for businesses to create waste segregation plans. By segregating a certain type of waste from other waste, businesses can reduce their environmental impact and save money. Businesses also need to consider creating recycling programs in order to help reduce the amount of plastic used in production. This would not only help protect our environment, but also help businesses save money as well. Lastly, we must do everything possible to limit the amount of energy used in manufacturing and promote renewable sources of energy. This will not only help save money on energy bills, but also help protect the environment.

Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.
