Idea 3: A new type of battery
An inventor has come up with a new type of battery that could be used in many different applications. This battery, called an energy storage battery, could help people save power and money by storing energy rather than using it when it's needed. This would be a big change for the batteries we use today, and it could lead to more sustainable energy sources.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative. In order to be successful, a business must provide value to its customers and compete with other companies on a regular basis. A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.

Conclusion: What are some lessons we can learn from history about Invention?
Invention is one of the most important aspects of human history. It has allowed us to make significant progress in many fields, including medicine, engineering, and transportation. However, there are also some lessons we can learn from history about Invention. For example, it is important to remember that Invention is a gradual process. The first step in any invention is to come up with an idea. Once you have a good idea, it is next important to find someone who can help you carry out your idea. Finally, it is important to make sure that your invention does what you hope it will do. If it fails miserably, then you may have wasted your time and energy trying to create something that doesn't work.

Innovative thinking: How do we think differently to change things?
We all know that innovation is key to success in any business. But what does it mean when we talk about innovation?
Innovation can be defined as the process of designing, producing, and using a new product or service in order to improve the quality or usability of an existing product. There are many different ways to think about innovation, but four main themes will be used throughout this article:1) new ways of looking at old problems; 2) using technology to help solve problems; 3) breaking down barriers between ideas and reality; and 4) creating value for others. 

When you think about innovative thinking, you first need to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, it’s important to explore different methods and concepts in order to find the most effective way to achieve your goals.
