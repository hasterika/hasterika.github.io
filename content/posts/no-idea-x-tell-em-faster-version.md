Ideas for movies: What can you make with your movies?
The possibilities for movies are endless, and there are a number of creative ideas you can use to make them even more special. Here are a few ideas:

2. Make a movie about your own life and career—or about your favorite movie scenes.
3. Adapt one of your favorite movies into a full-length feature film—or create a new version of an old movie with different music and visuals.
4. Create a retelling of one of your favorite movies based on its original story or setting.
5. Make an American remake or sequel of one of the world's biggest films—or adapt a classic European film into an American release.
