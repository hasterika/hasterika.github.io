Why creativity is important: What does it mean for business and life?
Creativity is important for business and life. It can mean new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply a different perspective on an old problem. In most cases, creativity is essential for businesses and people to continue their momentum and grow in their careers. However, it can also be dangerous to rely exclusively on creativity alone to solve problems, as it can quickly become exhausted and stale. There are a few factors that help to keep creativity fresh and ongoing, and these are key to success in any field: having a diverse range of ideas, keeping our imaginations active by letting them roam free, developing our creative abilities over time, being comfortable with risk and uncertainty, and always looking for ways to improve upon what weâ€™ve done before.

How to overcome creative blocks:
When it comes to being creative, sometimes the hardest part is getting started. If you're feeling stuck, here are a few tips to help you overcome those creative blocks and get those ideas flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, all you need is a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This can help refresh your mind and give you a new perspective on how to approach your project.

2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them. Hearing from others can jumpstart your own creativity.
