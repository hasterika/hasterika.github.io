Some of the key ideas behind this article are that digital natives can be used asassets for business growth, that they are more likely to adopt new technologies than those who were born in other generations, and that they are more likely to stay with a technology platform for longer periods of time.

What challenges does innovation face?
1. Innovation is faced with a number of challenges, including the challenge of meeting consumer demand while ensuring that products are safe and effective.
2. Innovation can also face challenges from producers and consumers alike, as well as from government agencies that may require new technology to meet specific goals or regulations.

3. There are a number of ways innovation can be tackled, and each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, using traditional methods to develop new products can be more expensive and time-consuming than using novel approaches or ideas to address consumer needs.

4. In order to ensure that innovation is productive and successful, businesses need to be able to identify potential problems early on and then address them in a way that solves the problem without creating additional problems.

The impact of innovation on society: What are the consequences?
Innovation has been a key part of society for centuries. It has allowed people to improve their lives and the way they live. However, recent years have seen a rise in innovation and its negative consequences. Innovation has led to new technologies and products that are more accurate, efficient, and powerful than ever before. This has created new opportunities for businesses and individuals to make money and improve their lives. However, there are also some negative consequences to innovation that can be traced back to society as a whole. These consequences can relate to economic growth, social stability, public health, job security, and more. To date, there is no definitive answer as to what the impact of innovation on society is. However, from a policy perspective, it is important to consider the potential implications of any change in how innovation is conducted or accepted by society.
