What are big ideas?
Big ideas are what get people thinking and sparking new ideas. By definition, big ideas are those that are difficult or impossible to imagine, but which offer a great potential for solving a problem. They can come from anywhere, in any field, and can range from the small to the large. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A new way to make money: This could be anything from starting a small business to developing a new technology.

2. A better way to care for your health: This could include things like finding a way to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins or developing more effective medical treatments.

3. A new way of transportation: This could include anything from building an electric vehicle to creating a flying car.

The history of AI: How has AI been developed over the years?
A key part of any AI development is understanding the motivations behind the work. This history can be broken down into three periods: the1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time. The 1980s saw a shift towards using AI for good; however, this shift was met with criticism from some who felt that AI had become excessive in its power.
