The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways to cook, Tate Modern’s newest art gallery or a new way of travelling. Here are some of our favourites:
1. A creative way to relax: take a walk in nature. This can involve finding a meadow with plenty of trees, sitting under a tree and taking in the natural sounds.

2. Experiment with different food preferences: try out different recipes or eat something that you’ve never tried before. This will open your eyes to what foods you like and how they taste.

3. Get creative with your time: use up time by doing something creative like painting, drawing or sculpting. This will help you de-stress and get lost in thought for a little bit.

What are the best ways to have ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. Without them, startups can't achieve their goals and achieve success. Here are 8 ways to have more ideas:
1. Take a walk around your neighbourhood. This will help you get a mental picture of what your business could look like and how it could Benefit the neighbourhood.
2. Get involved in community activities. Volunteering your time and energy to organisations that you believe in is a great way to get ideas for your business from people who already care about the world you're trying to build for them. 
3. Do some brainstorming with friends or family members. These conversations can help you come up with various concepts for your business, which can then be turned into realisations through brainstorming with others.
