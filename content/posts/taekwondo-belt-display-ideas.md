How do you come up with good ideas?
Ideas are a dime a dozen, but they often have the potential to be great. Here are three tips to come up with good ideas:
1. Take your time – don’t just give up on an idea right away. Start by thinking about it more closely and then coming up with potential ways that it could be improved.

2. Be open to feedback – If you don’t think your idea is good, ask other people for their opinions. This will help you get closer to the best version of your idea.

3. Be persistent – If you keep working on your idea, eventually it will become better.

Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product. It can be anything from developing a new toy to creating a new recipe. Inventors are often very creative and come up with great ideas when they have nothing else to go on. There are many different types of inventions, but the three that come to mind are: products, services, and ideas.
