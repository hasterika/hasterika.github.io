The power of a big idea: can change the way we think and see the world
Big ideas have the power to change the way we think and see the world. They can challenge our assumptions and help us to see things in new ways.


For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.



Big ideas can also change the way we see ourselves and our place in the world. The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.



So what is your big idea?

How To Come Up With Ideas: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to help something else become a reality. Whether it’s coming up with a new product idea or coming up with a plan to improve something you’re working on, creativity is essential to any successful project. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 1. Take your time – Don’t try to come up with an idea right away. In most cases, it won’t be the best option, and you may not get very far without some effort. 2. Be open to new ideas – There are always going to be new ways of thinking when it comes to ideas, so don’t be afraid to experiment.
