What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.

Ideas for social media: How can we promote our products and services?
Are you looking to develop social media platforms that can help promote your products and services? Here are a few ideas for how to go about it. 
1. Start by creating a social media profile for your business. This can include a username, website, and phone number. Make sure to have a strong presence on all types of social media platforms, as this will be your main source of marketing reach. 
2. Use influencer marketing techniques to reach more people on social media. If you have an existing following of popular bloggers or other influential individuals, reach out and ask them to endorse your product or service on their blog or other online outlet. This will allow you to build trust with potential customers and increase the likelihood they’ll visit your website or give you feedback. 
3. Join relevant communities and forums relevant to your industry or target market.
