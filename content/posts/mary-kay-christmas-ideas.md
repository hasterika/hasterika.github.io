How to brainstorm effectively
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you can do to make sure you're doing it effectively. First, it's important to have a clear goal in mind. What are you trying to achieve with this brainstorming session? Once you know what you're trying to accomplish, you can start generating ideas. It's helpful to write down every idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy or far-fetched it may seem. You can always weed out the bad ideas later. The goal is just to get as many ideas as possible at this stage. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. This will help you start narrowing down your options and come up with a plan of action. Brainstorming can be a great way to generate new ideas and solve problems, but only if you do it effectively.

Innovation in healthcare: What new technologies are coming soon?
The healthcare industry is constantly developing new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Some of these innovations are coming soon, while others may still take some time to develop. Here are two examples of the latter. 
One technology is called "smart technology." This refers to devices that are specifically designed to improve patient care, such as providing real-time alerts or tracking patient vital signs. This can reduce the amount of time patients spend on their chart, make it easier for nurses to find needed medical supplies and personnel, and ensure that patients receive the best possible care. 

The other innovation is called "telemedicine." This refers to delivery of medical care over the Internet or other digital platforms. telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by cutting costs and increasing efficiency.
