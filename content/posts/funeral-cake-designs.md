What are some big ideas?
Big ideas can be everything from initiating change to creating a new product or service. Here are some of the most commonly cited big ideas:
1. Create a new business model: A lot of businesses start with good intentions, but eventually fall short because they don't have a clear plan for how to turn their idea into a reality. One way to overcome this obstacle is to come up with radical new ideas that could help your business succeed.

2. Implement change: Change is always necessary in order for businesses to grow and succeed. Sometimes, it means taking risks that might not be seen as safe or sexy, but it can lead to real results. It's also important to remember that change takes time - sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time so you can make sure your business is on the right track before making any big changes.

The role of innovation in business: What are some applications of innovation?
Innovation is a term that is often used in business to describe new ideas or methods that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a business. This can be achieved through technological innovations, business model changes, or even product design changes. In recent years, innovation has become more important in businesses as it has become more difficult for companies to stay afloat with traditional methods such as investment and marketing. One way that businesses can use innovation to their advantage is by using it to improve customer service. By taking advantage of new technologies and developing processes that are less time-consuming, businesses can save time and money on customer service. Additionally, by using innovative marketing strategies, businesses can reach a wider audience and increase sales. The role of innovation in business is constantly changing and depends on the specific needs of the business. However, some applications of innovation are always beneficial for businesses.
