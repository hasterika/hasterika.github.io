The benefits of big thinking
If you want to change the world, you have to start by thinking big. That’s the premise behind big thinking: the belief that we can solve problems and create opportunities by coming up with large-scale solutions.
It’s an approach that has yielded some of the most important breakthroughs in history, from the discovery of vaccines to the development of nuclear power. And it’s an approach that is increasingly necessary in a world that is becoming more complex and interconnected.

Big thinking is about more than just coming up with big ideas. It’s also about having the courage to act on those ideas, even when they seem impossible. After all, it was a big thinker who said, “The impossible just takes a little longer.

Conclusion
After spending hours brainstorming and developing your invention idea, it's finally time to reach a conclusion. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you wrap up your project:
1. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. If you can't articulate the problem, you won't be able to sell your invention idea to others.

2. Do your research! Inventors who are well-informed about their industry and their competition are more likely to be successful. Make sure you know what's already out there and what needs improvement.

3. Have realistic expectations for your invention idea. It's important to be confident in your idea, but remember that not every great idea will become a multimillion-dollar business. Be prepared for bumps in the road and set reasonable goals for yourself and your team.
