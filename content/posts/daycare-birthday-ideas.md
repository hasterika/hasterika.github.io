Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.

Futures of technology
What do you think the future holds for technology? Some believe that it will continue to evolve and grow, while others predict that it will become more advanced and complex. Either way, there are a number of ideas that could be explored in order to further advance this field. Here are some possible scenarios:
1) In 2022, we may see advances in 3D printing technology that allow for objects to be created from multiple layers of plastic or other materials. This would allow for a significant increase in the number of products that can be manufactured on a large scale, as well as faster and easier production times.

2) Another development that could impact our industry is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). As machines get better at learning and responding to various challenges, they may become capable of performing tasks that were once considered impossible or too difficult for humans to perform.
