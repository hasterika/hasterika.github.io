Innovation is key to any business. Without innovation, businesses would not be able to compete in the marketplace.

There are a number of different ways innovation can help businesses succeed, but one of the most important methods is through creativity. By coming up with new ideas that are not commonly thought of and working on them until they become a reality, businesses are more likely to succeed than if they just stick to what is common wisdom.
