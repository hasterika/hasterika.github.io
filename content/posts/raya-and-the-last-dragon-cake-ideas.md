Why are big ideas so important?
Big ideas are the foundation of any great idea, and they can be a driving force behind your innovation. Here are five reasons why big ideas are so important:
1. They build on those that have been done before. A big idea is always new and original, making it easier to come up with new and innovative ideas. This makes it harder for others to copy, which in turn allows you to rest assured that your product or service will be successful.

2. They can help you focus on the right things. When you have a large number of big ideas circling around your head, it can be difficult to know where to start and what to focus on. By having a few big ideas at the forefront of your mind, you can more easily stay focused on what’s important and get the job done rather than trying too many things at once.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
