The benefits of creativity: How can it be used?
Creativity is a valuable tool that can be used to solve problems and create new ideas. There are many benefits to creativity, including making new friends, developing new skills, and increasing your productivity. Here are three ways creativity can be used in your life: 
1. Create original ideas: When you have an idea for a product or project, start by thinking about how you could make it better or more unique. Try to come up with a solution that nobody else has thought of before. This can be really helpful in getting started on a project or finding a solution to a problem.

2. Make connections: When you make new friends, it can be really helpful to get out and talk about your interests. It can also be fun to meet others who share the same interests as you do. This will help you develop relationships that are beneficial both professionally and personally.

Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.

How can a big idea be turned into a reality?
In business, big ideas are the lifeblood of success. They can be turned into reality with the right planning and execution. Here are five tips to make your big idea a reality:
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. When you know what your goals are, it's easier to prioritize and figure out how to reach them. This will help you draft an effective plan that will help you achieve your goals.

2. Make sure you have a compelling case for your big idea. Most businesses only do their best when they have a strong argument for why their product or service is worth existing. Make sure your case is clear, argumentative, and compelling enough to convince people to invest in your project - even if it's just for a couple of years!

3. crystallize your ideas into simple concepts.
