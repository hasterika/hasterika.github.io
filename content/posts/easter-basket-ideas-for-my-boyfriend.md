The barriers to innovation
Innovation is a key driver of economic growth. It allows firms to create new products and services and find new ways of doing things. However, innovation can be difficult to achieve. Firms face a number of barriers when trying to innovate, including a lack of resources, a risk-averse culture, and an unwillingness to change.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. Many firms do not have the money or the manpower to invest in new ideas. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge. This can make it difficult for them to identify opportunities for innovation and develop new products and services.

Another barrier to innovation is a risk-averse culture. Many firms are reluctant to take risks, preferring instead to stick with tried-and-tested methods.
