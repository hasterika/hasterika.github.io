Idea 3: We need to be more open about our values
The world is constantly changing, and so too are the ways that people value and hold onto certain values. In order to stay ahead of the curve, we need to be more open about our own values.
One way to do this is by sharing our thoughts with others. Another way is by writing down what we believe and why it matters to us. Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with someone who understands our values in order for us to start writing them down ourselves.

Ultimately, we need to be more conscious about how we value the things that matter most to us in order to stay ahead of the curve and stay true to our own values.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of making a new and improved product or service. Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means coming up with a new idea, developing a better product, or creating a new market niche. Innovation can also be seen as an indicator of success in a business. For example, Google was first to bring the internet to the masses in 1996 and Amazon has been selling books online for centuries. Despite these long histories, both entities have faced many challenges and have eventually become world-renowned companies.
