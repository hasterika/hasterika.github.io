The brainstroming phenomenon is when people's thoughts track the same topic for a sustained period of time. In some cases, this can be an extended period of time - for example, if someone has been thinking about the same subject constantly for a few days or weeks. In other cases, it may be more sporadic - for example, if someone thinks about the same topic once and then doesn't think about it for a week or two.
