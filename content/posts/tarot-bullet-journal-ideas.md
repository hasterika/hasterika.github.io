The Key: What are the essential steps in the creative process?
Creative ideas are like seeds. They can be sown in any direction, but they will eventually germinate and produce a flower. The key to success when it comes to creative ideas is to have a clear plan for how you want the idea to turn into a reality. Once you have a good Idea, the next step is to come up with specific details that will make it real. You need to know what your target market is, what your competition is, and what your goals are. Once you have all of these details nailed down, it's time to start planning the execution. You'll need to create a timeline, set up funding sources, and get started on developing your idea. If all of this sounds like too much work, don't worry! There are plenty of resources available online that can help you get started on your creative journey.

Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.
