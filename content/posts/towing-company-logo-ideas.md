Memory exercise: How can we improve our memory and concentration?
Memory is an important skill that we can use to improve our concentration and memory. Here are some ways to improve our memory:
1. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods help to create a strong immune system and keep our brains healthy.

2. Get enough exercise. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function and mental clarity.

3. Use brain teasers or mental puzzles to keep your mind active and engaged. Brain teasing tasks include things like finding the pattern in a jumble of numbers, solving complex math problems, or making decision trees.

4. Practice gratitude every day for all the good in our lives. Gratitude can boost mood, focus, and creativity; it can also help us remember positive experiences from past times.

What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything from what you want your business to do, to how you can make your product or service better. When it comes to starting a business, there are endless options and possibilities for what you can do. Here are some tips for getting started: 
1. Make an idea list- This will help you come up with ideas for your business that have nothing to do with the products or services that you offer. It can also be helpful to think about how you could improve upon what others have done before you.

2. Get creative- Start by coming up with new ways that you could market and sell your product or service. What if there was a more efficient way to ship products? How about developing a unique selling proposition (USP)? This will help get people interested in your product or service and increase sales potential.
