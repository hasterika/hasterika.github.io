Trends in technology: How will new technologies impact the way we live and work?
Technology has always been a part of our lives, but this is especially true in the 21st century. New technologies are causing great change in how we live and work, and some of the biggest changes are coming from artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.
Both AI and Robotics have the potential to completely change the way we live and work. Here are five reasons why:

1. Artificial intelligence will improve your productivity: AI can help you make better decisions faster, which will mean you can spend more time on tasks that matter. This is especially important if you want to achieve your goals as a businessperson or individual.

2. Robotics will help you work more safely: Robotics are making it easier for us to do different jobs at home, such as caring for our elderly or pet owners.
