What are some big ideas?
Big ideas can be everything from initiating change to creating a new product or service. Here are some of the most commonly cited big ideas:
1. Create a new business model: A lot of businesses start with good intentions, but eventually fall short because they don't have a clear plan for how to turn their idea into a reality. One way to overcome this obstacle is to come up with radical new ideas that could help your business succeed.

2. Implement change: Change is always necessary in order for businesses to grow and succeed. Sometimes, it means taking risks that might not be seen as safe or sexy, but it can lead to real results. It's also important to remember that change takes time - sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time so you can make sure your business is on the right track before making any big changes.
