Creativity has been shown to be a valuable trait in art, with many benefits for both the artist and the audience. Some of these benefits include:
1. Increased creativity and productivity – When artists are able to use their creativity to come up with new ideas, they are usually more productive overall. This can free up time for them to work on other projects, which can then lead to increased sales and better profits.

2. More interesting and engaging artwork – One of the biggest benefits of creativity is that it can help break down barriers between different disciplines and make art more engaging for both audiences. This can lead to more people becoming interested in watching or reading art, which can have a positive impact on financial success.

How does creativity impact our lives: What impacts creativity in our day-to-day lives?
Creativity is an important part of our day-to-day lives.

In fact, according to a study by The Economist, the average creative person in the United Kingdom earns over £50,000 more than the average non-creative person. This implies that creativity does have a significant impact on our lives in ways that are beyond just creating new things.
