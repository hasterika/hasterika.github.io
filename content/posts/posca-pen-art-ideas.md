Origins of creativity: How has creativity emerged over time, and what reasons do we have for expecting it to continue to grow?
Creativity has been around for a while, and there are several reasons why we think it will continue to grow. One reason is that creativity is oftenasured in terms of what can be done, rather than what is possible. For example, in architecture, the goal is to create something beautiful and unique, not to solve a problem. This focus on beauty means that architects can often come up with really creative ideas that don't solve any problems.

We constantly learn new things and try new things, so our minds are constantly evolving and growing more creative.
