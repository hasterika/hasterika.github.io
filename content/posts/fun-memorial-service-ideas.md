Impact of Innovation: What are some benefits to companies who embrace innovation?
Innovation is a key component of businesses that thrive. It allows companies to release new ideas and products faster, improve their efficiency and create new services or products. There are many benefits to companies who embrace innovation, but here are some of the most important: 
1. Increased Efficiency - Innovations allow companies to save time and money by productizing existing ideas or by creating new concepts that were not possible before. This can lead to increased profits and sustainability because it reduces the amount of time needed to produce a product or service. 
2. Improved Productivity - Innovation also helps businesses to produce more efficiently because it allows them to focus on certain tasks instead of having to spend time developing every aspect of their product or service. This can lead to higher levels of productivity and accuracy in their work, which is essential for businesses that rely on customer satisfaction and profitability.

The role of technology in promoting innovation?
Technology has often been seen as a facilitator of innovation, with the ability to help organizations make faster and more efficient decisions. However, recent studies have shown that technology can also be used in an adversarial role, promoting innovation in the wrong direction. For example, Google was found to be using its search engine to promote its own products instead of those of other companies.
