Tips for getting more out of creativity: From inspiration to principle to practice
When it comes to creativity, there are many different ways to approach it. However, one key factor is always to keep in mind the principle of creativity: It should be used for something new and exciting. Here are some tips on how to get more out of creativity:
1. Find inspiration from other sources. Whether you’re looking for ideas for a new piece of clothing or for a new way of thinking about an existing idea, looking at other cultures and their creative approaches can provide you with plenty of inspiration.

2. Think about principle. One of the most important things you can do when trying to come up with creative ideas is to think about what makes the idea special. What makes it unique? How will it be useful? these are all questions that can help you find the right principle behind your idea.

Filming: How do you film your creative ideas?
Filming Creative Ideas can be a pretty enlightening experience, if done correctly. Not only do you get to see your ideas in action, but you also get to learn how to capture and film creative moments that will help you grow as a filmmaker. Here are four tips to filming creative ideas: 1. Do your research: before you start shooting, it’s important to do your research on what type of footage is going to work best for your story. What does the audience want? What are the challenges of capturing that vision successfully? These questions will help determine the filming techniques that work best for your project. 2. Get creative: not all creativity is created equal. Sometimes, filming creative ideas can be more about experimenting than taking risks.
