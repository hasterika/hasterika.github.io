Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention refers to any new or unique product, service, process, or technology that is developed by an individual.

There are many different types of inventions and each has its own story and importance. Here are five of the most common:
1. Technology- A technological invention is any new invention that makes something easier or more efficient. For example, one example of a technological innovation is the development of vacuum cleaners that don't require electricity to work.
