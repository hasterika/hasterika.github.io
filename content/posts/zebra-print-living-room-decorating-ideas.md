Research: How to research your invention idea
If you have an invention idea, you may be wondering how to research it. There are a few ways to do this:
1. Talk to people who might use your invention. Ask them what they think of your idea, and whether they would be interested in using it.

2. Look for similar products that already exist. See how well they work and what kind of feedback they get from users.

3. Do a patent search to see if anyone has already patented a similar idea.

4. Talk to experts in the field, such as engineers or scientists, to get their opinion on your idea.

5. Make a prototype of your invention and test it out yourself. See how well it works and get feedback from people who use it.

Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
The Creative Art process begins with the artistâ€™s idea. This idea can be something as simple as a thought or a plan, but it is important that the artist is able to come up with an interesting and unique solution to the problem at hand. After coming up with an interesting solution, the artist continues working on this solution until they have a workflow that they are happy with. The artwork then becomes a product of this unique workflow.

1. Create a custom desk with an old dresser
If you're like most people, your work desk is more a collection of random pieces of furniture than an organized working space. It's easy to get disorganized when you don't have a specific goal in mind when designing your desk. So how do you create an actual working space for yourself? One way is to find an old dresser and turn it into a custom desk. You can use the drawer space for storage, or simply use the top drawer as a place to put your computer, printer, and other office supplies. This project can be completed in just a few hours, and it's a great way to show off your skills as an architect.
