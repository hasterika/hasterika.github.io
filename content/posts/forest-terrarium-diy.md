Requirements for innovation
Innovation is essential to the success of businesses and societies. However, some challenges companies face when it comes to innovation include:
-Lack of creativity: Many companies find it difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due in part to the rigid methods that are typically used in business. For example, most businesses have a traditional model where products are produced one after the other. This system limits the potential for creativity and producesfewer new ideas.

-Disruption: When a new idea comes along, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because they think it would be too expensive or hard to replicate. However, disruption is often what allows businesses to take risks and innovate new models.

How can people start thinking about new ideas?
Most people think of ideas when they are brainstorming, but there are other ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective. Here are three tips to help you get started: 
1. Give yourself time: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to allow yourself time to think about them. Don’t try to come up with any ideas in an instant. Take your time and consider everything that you have said before coming up with a new idea. 

2. Be open-minded: Once you have considered some potential ideas, it’s important that you be open-minded about them. If something doesn’t sound right or feels too farfetched, don’t be afraid to change your mind after thinking about it more. Remember that every idea has at least one potential application.

How to Innovate
Innovation is a key term when it comes to staying ahead of the competition. By understanding how innovation works, businesses can develop innovative ways to stay one step ahead. Here are three tips to help you achieve success:
1. Look at innovation from a systemic perspective. When looking at innovation from a systemic perspective, businesses should take into account the entire supply chain and the entire market. This means understanding how products and services are used and what opportunities exist for improvement.

2. Try out different methods of thinking. When trying out different methods of thinking, businesses should experiment with different ideas and see which ones work best for them. This will help them determine which innovations are most important to their business and which ones need further development.

3. Be patient with your experimentation.
