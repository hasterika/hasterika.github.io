The power of thought: What makes great ideas?
Creative ideas come from all over, but some of the most popular ones come from thought. Some people might say that great ideas come from a brainstorming session or being in a creative mode, but for some it's just thinking about something. Whether you're brainstorming a new product idea or coming up with a plan to save your company, it's important to have good thoughts in mind when coming up with new solutions. When you have these positive thoughts in your head, you're more likely to be able to see potential solutions and come up with the best one for your situation.

what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.
