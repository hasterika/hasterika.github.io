Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.

Innovation: How can new ideas be brought to market and be successful?
New ideas are one of the most important things that a company can bring to market. Successful companies have been able to develop new ideas that go beyond the standard and bring in new customers and profits. Here are some tips on how to bring your new idea to market:

This might be due to a lack of innovation, or it could be because your product is not yet available in an affordable price point. Regardless, make sure you are prepared to face rejection and continue working on your idea until it becomes a reality.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a powerful tool for improving business efficiency, creativity, and overall productivity. By having more ideas, businesses can move faster and make better decisions when it comes to product innovation, marketing campaigns, and even store design. In fact, the more ideas a business has, the harder it is to stay ahead of the competition. Here are four reasons why you should start taking advantage of all those innovative juices:
1. More Ideas Means Faster Product Development: When a business has more ideas on its plate, they're more likely to come up with better products that meet customer needs. Not only do they have more options to consider when coming up with new products, but they also have time to test different concepts and see which ones work best before moving forward with an actual product.

How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.
