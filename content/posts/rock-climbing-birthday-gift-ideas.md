There are many different types of creativity and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some artists prefer to use more traditional forms of creativity like brainstorming or problem solving in order to come up with new ideas, while others prefer more innovative methods such as appropriation or appropriationism. Ultimately, the key is to find what works best for you and let your creativity take over!
