Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It is important to note that creativity does not have to be applied in a creative way. It can also be used in mundane tasks, like writing a paper or completing an online quiz. However, creativity is often thought of as a quality that comes from the imagination and free thought.
