Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.

Invention as Art: The History of Invention and the Perceptions of the World
Invention is a process of coming up with new ideas or novel concepts that often change the world. It is an important part of society and economy, and has been used for centuries to create new products, services and ways of life. Invention has also been used to define different eras in history, such as the ancient Greeks who invented wine and cheese, the Romans who pioneered engineering and artillery, and the Americans who created radios, automobiles and other technological innovations.
There are a number of different perceptions of invention throughout history. Some people see invention as something that is automatically good, while others view it as something that can be done for profit or pleasure. There is also a significant difference in how people view invention when it comes to technology.
