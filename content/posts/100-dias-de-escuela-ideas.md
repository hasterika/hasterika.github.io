executed Projects: What makes a successful DIY project?
The best DIY projects are those that are executed flawlessly. There are a few key factors that make a successful project: 1) the right tools and materials; 2) a clear plan; 3) steady progress; and 4) timely communication. Here are three tips to help you create successful DIY projects:

Tools play an essential role in any DIY project, but it is especially important to use the right tools for the job.
