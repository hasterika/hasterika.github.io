Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design that is not yet known to anyone. Invention can come from anything, from a simple solution to a very innovative product. It can also come from a small isolated town in the middle of nowhere, and it can be done by someone who is just starting out. Inventions have made significant impacts on society and the economy, and continue to do so today.

The Creative Process: How does one go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come from anywhere, but the creative process typically starts with an idea. This idea is typically something that has been on someone’s mind for a while, but they have never had a good way to bring it to fruition. The creative process starts by sorting through all of the options and trying to find the best one for the project at hand. Next, the team needs to come up with a rough plan for how they will execute the idea. Once everything is set in stone, it’s time for creativity to take over!
