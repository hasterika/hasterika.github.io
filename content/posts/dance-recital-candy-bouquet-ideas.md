Brainstorming methods
There are a variety of ways to brainstorm invention ideas. One method is to think about problems you encounter in your daily life and try to come up with solutions. Another approach is to look at existing products and think about how they could be improved. You can also brainstorm with a group of people, which can help generate more ideas. Whichever method you choose, the goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible so that you can eventually find the best solution.
