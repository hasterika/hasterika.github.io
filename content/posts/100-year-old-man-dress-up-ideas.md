Ideas can be any thing that you want them to be, but they have to be ideas that you can think of. Usually, ideas come to you when you are in a hurry and don't have any time to think about them. Ideas can also come from your own thoughts or those of others. The best way to find out what ideas are around town is to take the initiative and start thinking about them yourself.

Conclusion
After months of toiling away on a project, it can be easy to feel like you've lost your creative edge. Fear not! Here are a few tips to help get your creative juices flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to get out of a rut is to take a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This will help you come back to your project with fresh eyes and new ideas.
2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them.
3. Doodle: Sometimes the quickest way to jump start your creativity is simply to start doodling.

Types of innovation: Product, process, service, and market.
Innovation is a key part of business. It allows companies to new ways of doing things and improve their products and services. Innovation can take many forms, including product, process, service, and market innovations. 
Product innovation is about coming up with a new way to do something. For example, a company could come up with a new way to make coffee that tastes better or be more environmentally-friendly. Process innovation is about making processes easier or faster so they can be done more efficiently. For example, a company could come up with a new way to produce food that is more consistent across different brands or produce food in less time than ever before. Service innovation is about making services better or easier to use so customers can have better experiences. For example, a company could create an online store that is easy to navigate or offer free shipping on orders over $70.
