nexpected Ways to Generate Ideas:
Big ideas are the seeds of change that can have a significant impact on society and businesses. By constantly thinking about new, innovative ways to solve problems and create value, companies and societies can rise to new heights. Here are 7 possible ways to generate big ideas: 1. Think outside the box: when it comes to problem-solving, there’s no limit to what you can imagine. come up with concepts or products that have never been thought of before. Even if your idea is nothing more than a wild guess, it still could be the next big thing. 2.
