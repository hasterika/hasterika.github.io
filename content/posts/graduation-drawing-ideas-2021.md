What are some of the new ideas out there and why should you be interested in them?
Some of the newer ideas out there could potentially change how you live, work and play. Some of them are even easier to implement than others, so it’s important that you decide whether or not they’re right for you. Here are three examples: 
1) Virtual Reality – This technology has the potential to completely change the way we interact with the world around us. By becoming a part of a virtual reality experience, you could learn new skills or explore different places without ever having to leave your home. 
2) Augmented Reality (AR) – This technology allows you to use tools and objects in your environment to create dynamic simulations. By using AR, you could become better at analyzing data or solving problems.

What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.
