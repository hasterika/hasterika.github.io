How to have big ideas
1. Want to have big ideas? You need to start by opening your mind. Be curious about the world around you and constantly ask yourself questions. Why does this happen? How could things be done better? When you're constantly challenging yourself to think differently, you'll start having bigger and better ideas.
2. It's also important to take risks. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things, even if they seem a little crazy at first. The best ideas often come from thinking outside the box. So go ahead and let your imagination run wild!

3. Finally, don't forget to share your ideas with others. brainstorming with friends or colleagues can help you develop your ideas further and turn them into reality. So don't be afraid to speak up - your big idea could change the world!
