The Creative Process: How does one go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come from anywhere, but the creative process typically starts with an idea. This idea is typically something that has been on someone’s mind for a while, but they have never had a good way to bring it to fruition. The creative process starts by sorting through all of the options and trying to find the best one for the project at hand. Next, the team needs to come up with a rough plan for how they will execute the idea. Once everything is set in stone, it’s time for creativity to take over!
