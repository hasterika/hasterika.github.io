When someone starts creating art, they are likely inspired by something that has caught their eye. This might be a picture, a scene from a movie, or something they see in their everyday life. The process of becoming finished product is often like the journey of getting inspiration from somewhere else. The artist must first determine what they want to create and then go through the creative process of coming up with ideas and putting those ideas into a form that can be seen and touched.

What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, product, or method. Invention can be found in everything from developing a new way to make a product to coming up with a new way to send information. Sometimes, invention is simply a good idea that someone has and doesn't have the time or resources to bring to fruition. In many cases, people become interested in invention after they come up with an idea that they believe could have potential applications.
