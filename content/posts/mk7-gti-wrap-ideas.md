Invention Ideas: How can they be put into practice?
Invention ideas can be put into practice in a number of ways. Some are more complicated than others, but all of them have the potential to make a big impact. Here are five possible ways: 
1. Use technology to create new products or services. This could take the form of developing new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, building virtual reality headsets or creating 3D printing coral reef models.
2. Use renewable energy sources to generate electricity from the sun or wind resources. This could involve developing solar panels, wind turbines or electric vehicles that run on diesel or gasoline instead of gasoline or oil. 
3. Use natural materials to make products or services more sustainable and environmentally friendly. These could include using bamboo for furniture, using recycled materials for insulation or recycling plastic bottles into water bottles and cups. 
4. Use recycled materials in new products or services.

What makes big ideas great?
Big ideas are a critical part of any business or organization. They help to spark new thought, improve efficiency, and create value for shareholders. But what makes big ideas great? There are a few key factors that can make an idea stand out from the rest.
Some big ideas come from people who have strong convictions and see the world in a different way than most. Others come from people who are passionate about their topic and have an uncommon view of the world. Still others are generated by a brainstorming session or a large group of individuals who share an Idea that someone else has put forward.

Whatever the source, when an idea is great, it has something special going for it that sets it apart from other options. This is why ideas are so important – they give businesses and organizations the opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to improve their operations or products.
