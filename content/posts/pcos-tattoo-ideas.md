Invention creation is difficult and time-consuming. After an invention is created, it must be tested and proven before it can be used in the real world. Many times, this is done by testing the invention on a small scale or simply using it as a model. However, if the invention is successful, then it must be taken to the next level and tested on a larger scale. This can take many months or even years.
