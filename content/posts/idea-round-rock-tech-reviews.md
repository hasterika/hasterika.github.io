How can we develop big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, anyone can have them. It's just a matter of coming up with a plan and executing it. Here are four tips that can help you get started:
1. Definition: What is your idea?

 defines your idea in the most concise way possible, which will give you more room to work on it without feeling overwhelmed. Once you've nailed down what your idea is, make sure that everyone who will need to hear it (including yourself) agrees on its importance. This will ensure that the idea has enough power to carry out its potential.

2. Execution: How are you going to execute your idea?

This is where things get tricky. If your plan isn't well- thought-out or if you don't have enough manpower or resources at your disposal, your idea won't be able to take off.

What is brainstroming?

The term "brainstroming" has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until 2006 that the term was coined to describe the phenomenon of individuals being overwhelmed by a single task or idea. The name comes from a phrase used by Eisenhower in his Farewell Address in 1961, where he spoke about the "massive national effort" which was needed to meet the challenges of the future. Brainstroming can be defined in many ways, but its most common definition would say that individuals are struggling to focus on one thing and unable to complete any other tasks. This can lead to an overall feeling of overwhelm or stress. It's important to note that not all people experience brainstroming at different times or in different ways.
