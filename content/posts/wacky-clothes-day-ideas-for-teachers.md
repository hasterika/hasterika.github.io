The benefits of creativity
Creativity is not only about being different; it’s about being better. It’s about problem-solving, and thinking outside the box. And it’s a skill that can be learned. Here are three benefits of being more creative:
1. You’ll be better at problem-solving.

When you have to come up with an original solution to a problem, you need to be able to think creatively. This means looking at the problem from different angles, and considering unconventional solutions.

2. You’ll be more successful in your career.
