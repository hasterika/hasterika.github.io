The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in people’s lives. Once theirmain objective has been achieved (and often not easily), they may start thinking about other things instead of delivering on their original promise.

2. Failing to deliver on expectations: Big ideas often involve significant changes that could have a significant impact on both people and businesses if not executed flawlessly.
