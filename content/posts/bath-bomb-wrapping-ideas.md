What is the creation process like?
Invention ideas are something that often come to people by surprises. They may be something that someone has been thinking about, or something that they were inspired by. The creation process is a crucial part of any invention, and can play a major role in how successful the invention is. There are many different steps involved in the creation process, and each one has its own importance. 
The first step is always brainstorming. This can be done either before or after the idea has been finalized. It is important to get rid of any bad ideas before they become a part of the product. This will help to make sure that the product is truly unique and innovative. Once an idea has been brainstormed, it needs to be tested. This can be done in many ways, but the most important part is to find a way that the product can be used in reality.
