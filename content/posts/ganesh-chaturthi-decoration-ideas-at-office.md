What is creative art and why should you care?
Creative art is a form of art that uses imagination and creativity to create something new. By definition, creative art is any art that is created using the power of imagination and creativity. There are many types of creative art, including photography, painting, poetry, sculpture, and music. Each artist creates their own unique brand of creative art.
There are several reasons why you should care about creative art. First, creative artists often use their own imagination and creativity to create new works of art. This can be very rewarding because it allows them to explore their repertoire of skills in a way that they may not have been able to do with other forms of artistic expression.

This can lead to interesting outcomes that you might not have found if you were just looking for traditional Approaches to Art.

What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design. Innovation is key to businesses and societies, both here in the United States and around the world. And while it can come from any form of creativity-from simple change to groundbreaking technology-invention has a special history and meaning in America.
It was on July 14, 1776, when Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that each state was an independent nation with its own rights and destiny. Inventions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome had helped make these ideas a reality. But what made America unique? The answer lies in its history of innovation, not just as a country but also as a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their ideas and dreams.

Innovation is at the heart of American identity.
