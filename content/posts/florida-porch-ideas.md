What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives.

Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status.

But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

Idea 3: A new type of battery
An inventor has come up with a new type of battery that could be used in many different applications. This battery, called an energy storage battery, could help people save power and money by storing energy rather than using it when it's needed.
