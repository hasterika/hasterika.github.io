Choosing the right location for your small business
Small businesses are vital to our economy and society, but they can be difficult to manage on a budget. Here are some tips for choosing the best location for your small business.

3. Consider your expenses: You may want to consider the cost of living in your area before making a decision about where to set up shop. 
4.Consider the climate: If you plan on operating in cold or hot climates, make sure you have appropriate insurance and planning for cooling off times when necessary.
