Other Ideas: How do you go about thinking of other creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to improve the process of thinking. Here are a few tips on how to consider other creative ideas:
1. Look at your current work and ask yourself what you can improve. What are the areas that need improvement? How can you make those improvements?
2. Brainstorm with a group of people. When you come up with new ideas, it can be helpful to have others involved. Why not group together and brainstorm some potential solutions to problems you're currently facing? This will help you to formulate new ideas more effectively.
3. Take a step back and think about your goals. Once you've identified some areas that need improvement, what do you want to achieve with your change? What kind of results do you envision for your new efforts?

How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.
