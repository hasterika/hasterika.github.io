Most people seem to think of it as a thing that happens to creatives when they try to do something new or different, and it takes up space in their brain. But what is creativeblocking really? Is it something that you have to experience for yourself to understand, or can it be learned? Here are 8 things you need to know about creativeblocking if you want to be more creative: 
1) It starts with setting your boundary

Projects: How do you go about creating your DIY project?
There are many ways to create a DIY project, but the most common way is by finding a family member or friend to help. This can be done by asking them for help with a task they are familiar with, or by asking if they have any tools or supplies that you could borrow. There are many resources available online and in stores, so it is important to research what you need before beginning a project. Once you have an idea of what you want to create, it is important to find creative ideas. Some commonDIY projects include painting ceilings, fixing glass windows, and making furniture.

Creativedesigners on the go
Creativedesigners are on the go, and that means they need to be creative when it comes to their work. Whether they're working from home or on the go, creativity is key to success. Here are four ways creative designers can keep their work organized and on track:
1. Create a To-Do List: A to-do list can help keep things organized and on track. Not only does it make life easier, but keeping a to-do list can also help you stay inspired as you work.

2. Use NiceNotes: Another great way to keep things organized is using NiceNotes. Not only do they look pretty, but they also have a variety of uses (such as for brainstorming).

3. Keep Workspaces Clean: One way to stay focused while working is by keeping your workspace clean.
