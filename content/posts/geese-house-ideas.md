Immigration and globalization: How will these issues affect the workforce and social stability?
In the year 2022, immigration and globalization will have a significant impact on the workforce and social stability. With more people moving to countries such as China and India, there is an increased demand for workers. This has led to a rise in the number of jobs available in these countries, but also a decrease in the number of people who can actually fill them.
