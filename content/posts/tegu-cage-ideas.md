The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.
