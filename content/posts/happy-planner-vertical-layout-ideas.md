The definition of creative art can vary depending on the person, but typically it includes:
1. A deep connection to the individual audience or subject matter.
2. An ability to evoke strong emotions in the viewer or listener.
3. Uniquely configured elements or techniques that create an original experience.
4. A style that is not easily reproduced or adapted without significant additional work or creativity required from the artist.

The future of transportation
The future of transportation is packed with potential. Some of the ideas being floated include: driverless cars, totally autonomous transportation, and even flying cars. All of these projects have a lot of potential to improve our quality of life and save us money in the long run. But how do you go about making these ideas a reality?

2. Get involved in community deliberations

The process starts with identifying the main thoughts in your mind and then sorting them into piles or groups. From there, you can start to work on one or more specific tasks based on what you’ve assigned to those thoughts.
