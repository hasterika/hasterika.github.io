How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many benefits to having them. Ideas can help solve problems, provide new perspectives, and even change the course of history. Here are five ways in which ideas can benefit individuals and organizations: 
1. Ideas can help people think differently. When people have different ideas about a problem or issue, they can come up with more solutions than if they were just following the same path. By sharing their own perspectives and thoughts, people can form better plans and strategies for solving problems. 
2. Ideas can help organizations grow. One of the best things about having ideas is that they give organizations a range of options for new products, services, or directions. This allows businesses to explore different paths and figure out what works best for them while also staying afloat in a changing market landscape.
