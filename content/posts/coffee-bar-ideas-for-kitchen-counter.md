Overcoming obstacles: Discuss the challenges that inventors face and how they overcome them.
Invention is the process of coming up with an idea and turning it into a reality. It is a process that takes time, effort, and determination. Inventors often face many obstacles along the way, but they overcome them by being persistent and finding creative solutions.
One of the biggest challenges that inventors face is funding. Turning an idea into a reality can be expensive, and many inventors don’t have the money to do it on their own. They may need to find investors or take out loans to finance their invention.

Another obstacle that inventors face is making sure their invention is unique. There are already so many products on the market, and it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. Inventors need to do their research and make sure their product is filling a need that isn’t being met by existing products.

Idea 3: How do we use ideas?
Ideas can be put to use in many ways, but one of the most common is turning them into action plans. Whether you're looking to start a business, improve your fitness routine, or just think of new ways to spend your free time, ideas are a great way to get started. Here are three simple tips on how to use ideas to create ACTION plans:
1. Look at what other people have done and come up with ideas for things that you could do yourself too.
2. Take some time for yourself and come up with 10-15 different ideas for things you could do in your spare time. Once you've narrowed it down, take a look at Action Items and see what devices or activities work best for each one.
