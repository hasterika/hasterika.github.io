Mental training: What is it, how can we do it, and why should we bother?
Mental training is the process of increasing a person's ability to think, focus, and decision-making. There are many reasons to care about mental training, including improving your work performance, increasing your overall well-being, and preventing depression and anxiety. Here are five big ideas about how mental training can benefit you:
1. Improve Your Work Performance: Mental training can help you better focus on tasks at hand and achieve success in your workplace. In a study published in the journal "Personality Psychology," researchers found that people who had learned to think faster were more productive than those who did not. The faster you learn to think, the better prepared you will be for any task that comes your way.

2. Increase Your Overall Well-Being: Mental training has been shown to improve mood and reduce stress levels.
