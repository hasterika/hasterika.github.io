Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when thinking about big ideas?
Big ideas are something that can change the world. They are thinkpieces that have the potential to change how we live, work, and think about the world. There are a few things to keep in mind when thinking about big ideas. 
1. Make sure your idea is worth pursuing. If your idea isnâ€™t worth pursuing, it wonâ€™t get implemented or scaled up. 
2. Be realistic about what you can do and what you canâ€™t do. If you donâ€™t have the resources or experience to make your idea a reality, be realistic about how much effort and time it will require to bring it to market. 
3. Donâ€™t over-estimate your skillset or abilities.
