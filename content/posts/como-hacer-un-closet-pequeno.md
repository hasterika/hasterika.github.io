For example, if you’re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium. However, if you’re a sculptor and you want to create pieces that are dark and moody, then you might use painting as your medium. The point is that there is no one right way to do creative art - it all depends on the artist's preferences and what they're interested in doing.

Why should people care about it?
There are many reasons why people should care about climate change, but some of the most pressing ones include: increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events; loss of life due to climate-related disasters; and the high cost of inaction.
One way to help mitigate climate change is by using technology to create more accurate predictions of future weather patterns, as well as developing more efficient energy systems.
