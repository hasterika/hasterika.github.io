Brainstorming: What is brainstorming?
The purpose of brainstorming is to come up with new and innovative ideas. However, many people confuse brainstorming with brainstorming exercises. The two are completely different activities.
In a brainstorm, you don’t actually come up with new ideas; you just share your thoughts and ideas with others. It can be a great way to get feedback on what you’re working on and to get feedback on how others might view your idea.

When using brainstorming exercises, however, it’s important to keep the focus on coming up with new and innovative ideas. These exercises help you develop your thinking skills, but they aren’t substitutes for actual creative problem-solving.

Use of inventions in business: Why is this important?
invention ideas are important because they can help businesses save time and money. By using inventions, businesses can improve their products or services, slashed costs, and increased innovation. Here are three examples of how inventions have helped businesses: 
1. A key to a successful cosmetics company was the development of a new shade of lipstick that could be worn in all light colors. This led to the development of other popular shades, as well as new products such as lip balms and foundation kits. 
2. Another example is the development of a time-saving coffee maker that used drip coffee instead of pods. This led to lower costs for coffee and more efficient manufacturing processes.
3. The development of an air conditioning unit has allowed homes to be cooled much faster than previously possible. This has saved lives, particularly during summer heat waves.

The creative process
The creative process is a journey that can be both exciting and challenging. It is a process that requires both left brain and right brain thinking. The left brain is responsible for logical, linear, and sequential thinking. The right brain is responsible for more creative, intuitive, and nonlinear thinking.
The creative process often begins with an idea or a problem that needs to be solved. The first step is to gather information about the problem or the challenge at hand. Once the information has been gathered, it is time to start generating ideas. This is where the left brain and the right brain need to work together. The left brain will come up with logical solutions while the right brain will come up with more creative solutions.

Once ideas have been generated, it is time to start narrowing down the options. This step requires both critical thinking and creativity.

The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.
