Future Directions for Innovation:
Innovation is a key to the future of the economy and society. However, as innovation increases, it becomes more difficult to keep up with. This is due to the fact that innovation requires time and money. In order to maintain a strong innovation culture, government should support innovation by providing resources and making it easier for businesses to access these resources. Government should also encourage companies to be innovative by offering incentive programs such as tax breaks and subsidies.
