The history of innovation
Innovation is a core element of the American way of life and economy. Innovation has been a driving force in technological progress, economic growth, and social progress for centuries. However, there have been periods when innovation has not been as fruitful as others. One such period was the late 19th century when many innovative technologies were not adopted or developed as quickly as desired.

Basic Tips for Doing a Better Job: Be sure to follow these Basic Tips before starting any DIY project, and you'll get the job done right.
If you're looking to improve your DIY skills, there are a few things you should keep in mind before beginning any project. Here are some basic tips to help you get started: 
1) Follow the instructions thoroughly - if something isn't working correctly, take it to someone who knows more about it than you do. This will help prevent any surprises down the line and make sure your project is completed on time and without incident. 

2) Have a plan - once you've got the basics down, it's important to create a plan for how you'll go about completing your project. This will help ensure that everything goes as planned and that nothing gets lost in the process. 

3) Be organized - when trying to complete a project by yourself, it can be helpful to have a list of supplies and items involved.
