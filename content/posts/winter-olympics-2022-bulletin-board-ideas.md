Origin of Invention Ideas: How did people come up with invention ideas?
Invention ideas are often based on something that someone has seen or experienced. Invention ideas can also come from scratch, or from a combination of two or more different ideas. In some cases, people may even come up with multiple ideas before settling on one that is good. What makes an invention idea particularly interesting is the potential for it to improve someone’s life or make a difference in the world.
