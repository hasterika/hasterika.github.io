Innovation: How can we make our ideas more effective?
As we look to the future and plan for how to better serve our clients and ourselves, innovation is a key component. Here are five ways to embrace innovation in your business: 
1. Make sure you have a clear idea of what you’re trying to achieve. This will help you determine the best way to create value for your customers and yourself. 
2. Prototype ideas before you present them to others. This will help you get feedback and learn from your audience before putting your idea into action. 
3. Get feedback from people who matter in your industry. This can help you improve your product or service after seeing how it’s used by others. 
4. Take advantage of technology to help speed up process, increase accuracy, or reduce waste.
