Conclusion: What are some big ideas to consider for your blog or website?
When it comes to content, a blog or website is all about creating an audience. Whether you’re looking to generate new readers or keep an audience engaged with your current content, there are a few big ideas you can consider for your site. 
The first big idea is to focus on topic exclusivity. This means that you only focused on one aspect of your subject matter and made sure that it was the most important aspect of your blog or website. By doing this, you’ve narrowed down the topics that your readers will be interested in and will be more likely to stick around for as long as possible. 

Another big idea is to make sure that your blog or website is easy to navigate. This means making sure that every page has a clear title, header, and menu system so that readers can quickly find what they’re looking for.
