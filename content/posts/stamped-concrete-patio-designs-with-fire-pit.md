Topic 1: How to come up with new ideas
1. There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes the best way is to just think about what you've seen or heard and then come up with something new. Other times, you may have to get creative. If you're stuck, check out these resources: http://www.thespruceeats.com/new-ideas-2769464
2. It's also important to be open to new ideas if you want to keep your creativity alive. The more you're willing to try, the better off you'll be. One way to do this is by accepting that there may not be anything that fits your idea perfectly right away. That's okay! You can always tweak it until it works for you and still keep the idea interesting.

Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers.
