The future of work: Will there be more jobs or less work available?
The future of work is a question that has been asked for years, and with the current economy, it seems to be getting more and more difficult to answer. What could happen in the next few years that would change this? One possible change could be the increase in automation, which could lead to a decrease in the number of jobs available. Another possibility is a rise in interest in technology, which could lead to a rise in the number of jobs available. However, it all depends on what other factors are going on at that particular time.
