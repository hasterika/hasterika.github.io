What is creativity?
Creativity is a term that has been used throughout history to describe different aspects of thought, art and creativity. While many people may say that creativity is simply the ability of humans to create, there are other aspects to creativity that have been explored by scientists and researchers. For example, in some studies it has been shown that creativity is associated with a lack of fear or shyness when it comes to new challenges. Additionally, creativity can be used to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems.
