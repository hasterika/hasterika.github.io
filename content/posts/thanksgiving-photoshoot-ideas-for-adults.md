Conclusion: Some final thoughts on creativity
Creativity is one of the most important aspects of life. Whether we are creating new ideas or just coming up with new ways to do things, creativity is essential in any business or creative project. However, while creativity can be a great asset, there are also some risks associated with it. Here are a few final thoughts on creativity: 
1. Some people believe that creativity is only possible when you have a large amount of free time. While this may be true for some people, others find it difficult to come up with new ideas if they are constantly kept busy. So if you want to achieve success as a creative person, try to find ways to relax and allow yourself time for thought and inspiration. 

2. It’s important to remember that not everyone is born with the same level of creativity.

what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.
