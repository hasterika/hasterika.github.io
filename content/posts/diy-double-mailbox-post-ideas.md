Invention can be seen as one of the most beneficial aspects of humanity. It has opened up new opportunities for people to achieve their goals and have a better life. There are many inventions that have been made throughout history, some that we know about and others that we may not. Some of the benefits of invention include: 
-Improved technology: Inventions make it possible for people to use more efficient or effective methods to do things they had never thought possible. For example, when oak trees were used to make bows and arrows, this allowed people to shoot farther than they ever could before.
