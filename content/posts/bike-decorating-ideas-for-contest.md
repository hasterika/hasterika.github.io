Introduce the topic of ideas.
There are a lot of ideas out there. Some are good, and some are bad. But how do you know which ones are worth your time? In this article, we'll introduce the topic of ideas and explore some ways to tell if an idea is worth your time.
First, let's define what we mean by "idea." An idea is a potential solution to a problem or a new way of doing something. It's something that you can turn into reality with enough effort.

Not all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are better than others. To evaluate an idea, ask yourself these questions:

-Does this idea solve a real problem?
-Is this idea original?
-Is this idea feasible?
-Is this idea valuable?

What are big ideas?
Some people might say that ideas are what make the world go round, and for some, big ideas are what get them up in the morning. Whatever your definition of big idea, there’s no doubt that it’s a powerful force in life. Here are five of our favorite big ideas: 
1. Start with one. This may seem like a ridiculously simple suggestion, but if you don’t have any big ideas to start with, you won’t be able to come up with anything great. After all, success isn’t about having a lot of small accomplishments; it’s about achieving great things starting small.

Conclusion: Some tips for staying creative.
Creativity is key to a successful life. With the right tools, creativity can be unleashed to achieve anything you set your mind to. Here are a few tips to help you stay creative: 1. Take time for yourself – if you don’t have time for creativity, it won’t flow out of you. Slow down and allow yourself some time for yourself so that you can come back with fresh ideas. 2. Get organized – once you have an idea, try to organize it so that it feels like a project instead of something that just needs to be done. This will help keep your brain active and focused on the task at hand. 3. Be open to feedback – negative or positive feedback will help you develop new ideas and come up with new ways of thinking about things.

However, every invention has at its core an idea that could be implemented in a more efficient or effective way. While some may seem like impossible endeavors, with enough perseverance and creativity, anything is possible.
