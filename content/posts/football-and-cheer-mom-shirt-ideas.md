How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that involves the use of imagination and creativity. It is important to note that creativity does not work in a straight line, but rather it is constantly evolving. This means that it can change and develop over time. Creative art often contains elements of the Unknown or the inexplicable, which allows for the viewer to interact with the artwork in a different way than if it were just a series of instructions written down.
