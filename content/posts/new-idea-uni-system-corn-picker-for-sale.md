What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.

How can this new idea be implemented?
There is a new idea that could be implemented in the healthcare industry that is called electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are a type of online system where patients can keep track of their health information and see updated information about their care. This would free up doctor’s time to focus on more important tasks, such as patient examination and treatment. Additionally, it would make it easier for nurses to communicate with doctors, since they would have access to all the information the patient has on their record.

Why do we need ideas?
Think about the last time you came up with an idea. How did it feel? Did everything click into place and do what you wanted? If not, why not?
Ideas are essential to our success. Without them, we would be at a disadvantage in any field we choose to pursue. However, they can also be frustrating and time-consuming to come up with. So how do we make sure that our ideas turn into successful projects? Here are a few tips: 

1) Make sure your ideas are grounded in reality 
Ideas should only be based on what you've seen or experienced before. Otherwise, they will likely be scrapped before they even get started. 
2) Be organized and structured 
Ideas need to be broken down into specific steps and goals so that they can be completed quickly and easily.
