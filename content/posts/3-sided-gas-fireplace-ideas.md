Guidelines for creativity
Creativity is a Keyword for Today's World
There are many ways to be creative and some people believe that creativity is only found in the arts. Others believe that creativity can be found in any activity that leads to new ideas or solutions. The guidelines for being creative are as follows:

1. Be open to new ideas. This means that you should not be afraid to experiment with what you do, even if it does not seem fun or interesting at first. It can result in some great ideas that can help make your work more successful.

2. Allow yourself time and space to brainstorm. It takes time and effort to come up with new ideas, so don't try to do too much at once. Give yourself enough time so that you can come up with several good ones before having to choose one.

What makes big ideas great?
Big ideas are a critical part of any business or organization. They help to spark new thought, improve efficiency, and create value for shareholders. But what makes big ideas great? There are a few key factors that can make an idea stand out from the rest.
Some big ideas come from people who have strong convictions and see the world in a different way than most. Others come from people who are passionate about their topic and have an uncommon view of the world. Still others are generated by a brainstorming session or a large group of individuals who share an Idea that someone else has put forward.

Whatever the source, when an idea is great, it has something special going for it that sets it apart from other options. This is why ideas are so important – they give businesses and organizations the opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to improve their operations or products.
