The impact of globalization on business: What will be the largest impacts from globalization in 2022?
When it comes to business, globalization is quickly on the rise. With more people living in cities and countries near by, businesses have to adapt or go out of business. In 2022, there are many big global changes that will have an impact on businesses and individuals. Here are some of the biggest potential impacts: 
1) The rise in electronic commerce will lead to increased demand for goods and services from all over the world. This increase in demand can be difficult to meet, as manufacturers must compress production times and find new ways to reach consumers. 
2) Rising labor costs will hike prices for goods and services, even for low-cost countries. This increase in costs can force companies to reduce their output or even close their doors altogether. 
3) A crackdown on tax evasion by multinational corporations could lead to increased taxes on these companiesâ€™ profits worldwide.
