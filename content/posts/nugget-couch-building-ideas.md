The power of creativity: What does it mean for artists?
Creativity is a key word when it comes to artists. It can mean different things to different people, but in general, creativity refers to the ability of an individual to come up with new and innovative ideas. This doesn’t just mean coming up with new ways to look at an old problem or coming up with new solutions to old problems; creativity can also be used to come up with new ways of looking at things. For example, if you were a painter and you wanted to create a painting that depicted the history of art, you might come up with something that showed how various Artists have used their creativity in order to create their work. In fact, some artists even go so far as to say that creativity is the only thing that separates them from other professional artists.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.
