What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

What are some new ideas to consider?
There are many new ideas to consider when it comes to mental health, such as creating a support system for those with mental illness, expanding access to substances that can help reduce symptoms, and developing treatments specifically tailored to the needs of people withmental illness.

There is a wealth of information available online and in books about how to create one, but often people don't have the time or resources to do so. A good way to start is by finding a support group for those with mental illness who are not currently using services. This can be done through online social networks or through local organizations.
