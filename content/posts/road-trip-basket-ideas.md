Types of innovation: How they work
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been previously created. Innovation can be found in all industries, but is most common in the technology industry. In order to create innovative products or services, companies must first come up with a new idea, and then develop and test it so that it works. There are a number of different types of innovation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. 
Product innovation: This type of innovation usually occurs when a company comes up with a new product idea that they believe will be successful. They then work on developing the product until it is ready to sell. Product development can be time-consuming, but can also lead to high profits if the product is successful. 

Service innovation: This type of innovation often occurs when companies come up with new ways to provide their customers with service.
