Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individual’s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.

The Future of Invention: We are in a golden age of invention and creativity.
Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.
The recent surge in innovation has been fueled by three main factors: technology, energy and human creativity. With technology getting ever better, more people are able to access new knowledge and ideas faster than ever before. This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

On the other hand, energy is becoming increasingly scarce, making it even harder for companies to come up with new ideas. But this isn’t stopping companies from trying – there are now dozens of startups that are using solar energy to create new products and services.

Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.
