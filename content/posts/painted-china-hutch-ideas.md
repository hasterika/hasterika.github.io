Winter weather: Tips to keep your home warm
If you're like most people, you probably think of winter as the time when your house is cold and unused. But that's not always the case. In fact, there are a few things you can do to keep your home warm during the winter. Here are some tips:
1) Keep your windows open at all times. This will let in natural sunlight, which will help keep your home warm.
2) Use a fireplace or heat pad. Fires add warmth to any space, and they also emit noxious gases which can help block out wind noise and cold air from coming in.
3) Place an electric blanket over every piece of furniture in your room. This will place an electric field between yourself and the elements, which will help keep you warm (or cooler) during the winter months.

Ideas that work: Why do some ideas work and others don't?
Creative ideas are often the most successful, but it can be tough to know why. Here are four reasons:
1. You have to be willing to try something.
2. What you think is working may not be working for others, so you have to come up with a new idea that does what they want and works for you.
3. Your idea might not be original, but it's more likely to work because it's been tried before or because someone else has already created a similar product or service that people are using and liking.
4. Your idea might be better than what's currently out there, so give your stuff a go and see whether it works or not – even if it doesn't quite fit the mold of what everyoneelse is doing!
