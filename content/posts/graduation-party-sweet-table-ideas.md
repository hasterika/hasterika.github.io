The five types of brainstorming: open, collaborative, focused, problem-solving, and creative.
Brainstorming is one of the most essential skills for any business or professional. It can be used for creative problem solving, brainstorming for ideas for products and services, and more. However, not all brainstorming sessions are created equal. Here are five different types of brainstorming that can help improve your session productivity: 
1. Open brainstorming: This type of brainstorming is usually used when there is no specific goal to achieve or when everyone is free to come and go as they please. In this type of session, everyone is given a set amount of time to come up with ideas and then those ideas are prioritized based on how important they think they are.

2. Collaborative brainstorming: This type of brainstorming helps teams work together towards a common goal.

The five types of ideas: creative,icidal, practical, educational, and entertaining.
Creative ideas can be anything from cleaning up your basement to starting a business. They can be fun and enjoyable, or they can have a serious purpose. Educational ideas are important, especially for younger generations who are just starting out in life. They can help teach them about different topics and how to get things done. Practical ideas are great for people who need to do things quickly or who don't have time to waste. Some examples of practical ideas include becoming a doctor, lawyer, or mechanic. The last type of idea is the most interesting and entertaining, because it can bring people together in a shared interest. For example, if you're an artist, you might want to start a painting blog or create a YouTube channel about your work.
