Patent and Patenting in Invention
Patenting is a process of making a claim to an invention. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to use the invention for the lifetime of the patent, or until someone else patents it. Patents can be granted for any sort of invention, from simple ideas to complex technology. While it can be expensive and time-consuming to get a patent, being able to use a patented invention can give you an edge in competition.
