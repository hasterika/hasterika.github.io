How can a big idea be turned into a reality?
In business, big ideas are the lifeblood of success. They can be turned into reality with the right planning and execution. Here are five tips to make your big idea a reality:
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. When you know what your goals are, it's easier to prioritize and figure out how to reach them. This will help you draft an effective plan that will help you achieve your goals.

2. Make sure you have a compelling case for your big idea. Most businesses only do their best when they have a strong argument for why their product or service is worth existing. Make sure your case is clear, argumentative, and compelling enough to convince people to invest in your project - even if it's just for a couple of years!

3. crystallize your ideas into simple concepts.

Idea 3: A new way to communicate information
An invention that could be used to communicate information more effectively than ever before is a technology called "messageUltra." This new communication system would use sound waves instead of text or images to convey information. The sound waves would be sent through the air and sent directly to the recipient's ears, allowing them to hear the message without having to read it. This could be an extremely helpful tool for schools, businesses, and other organizations who need to communicate with large groups of people more efficiently.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.
