Invention as a process: How does one come up with new ideas?
One important step in the process of coming up with new ideas is to have a brainstorm. A brainstorming session is an opportunity for individuals to come up with new ideas without having to worry about whether or not they will be accepted. By using a brainstorming session, you can quickly and easily come up with new ideas that could potentially solve a problem. 
The best way to create a good brainstorming session is by creating a agenda beforehand and setting boundaries for who can participate. You should also make sure that everyone has something they are willing to share, so that everyone has an equal say in the discussion. It is important to do this because it will help free up energy and allow everyone to focus on their individual Ideas rather than worrying about how others might react. Once you have started the meeting, it’s important to give everyone some time before taking any decisions.
