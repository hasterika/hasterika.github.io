The 5 Types of Ideas: What they are, what they can do, when to use them, and how we can get started
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help us solve problems. Here are five types of ideas to get started with:
1. Problem identifies and solves: This type of idea is used when you have a specific problem to solve, and there are no other options available. For example, if you’re lost and need to find your way home, you might use this type of idea to identify the problem and come up with a plan to fix it.

The creation process: How a person goes from inspiration to finished product
When someone starts creating art, they are likely inspired by something that has caught their eye. This might be a picture, a scene from a movie, or something they see in their everyday life. The process of becoming finished product is often like the journey of getting inspiration from somewhere else. The artist must first determine what they want to create and then go through the creative process of coming up with ideas and putting those ideas into a form that can be seen and touched.
