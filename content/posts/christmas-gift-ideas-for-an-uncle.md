The definition of creativity
Creativity is a mental process which refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, solutions or products. It can be described in different ways but ultimately it is what makes us unique and makes us stand out from the rest. Creative art is often seen as an area where creativity flourishes, as it offers an escape from reality and allows people to become creative problem solvers. In order to be considered creative, an artist must have a strong imagination, be able to see things in a new light and be willing to experiment.
