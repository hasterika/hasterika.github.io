How to make your home more comfortable
If you're looking for ways to make your home more comfortable, there are a variety of ways to go about it. Here are a few tips to get the most out of your comfort zone: 
1. Try adding a couch or bed in the living room. This will give you space to relax and watch TV, while improving your visibility and calming atmosphere. 
2. Add some plants or stuffed animals to help improve your mood and circulation. 
3. Get a fan in the bedroom so that you can cool off when you're not using the bathroom or bedroom. 
4. Install an air conditioner in winter if you can't find one outside or add window AC if that's an option for you. 
5. Get a recliner or rocker for relaxation in the living room or bedroom instead of just sitting on the floor all day long!
