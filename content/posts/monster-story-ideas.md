2. Autonomous Vehicles: This is an idea that has been gaining traction recently due to its potential for reducing traffic congestion and improving public transportation options.

Ideas for the environment: How can we conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment?
The future of the environment is important to all of us, and we need to find ways to conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment. Here are some ideas for the environment in 2022: 
1. Use organic materials when possible. This includes not just food, but also products made with natural ingredients. It can be tough to make this switch, but it’s worth it in the long run. 
2. Vehicle emissions need to be reduced. This will require concerted effort from both the government and businesses, but it’s something that we can achieve if we work together. 
3. Reduce energy use in homes and businesses. This can be done by retrofitting buildings or installing more efficient equipment. It’s important to take small steps rather than making drastic changes all at once, though. 
4. Foster a sustainable agriculture industry.
