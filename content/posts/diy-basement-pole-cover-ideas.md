Immigration and globalization: How will these issues affect the workforce and social stability?
In the year 2022, immigration and globalization will have a significant impact on the workforce and social stability. With more people moving to countries such as China and India, there is an increased demand for workers. This has led to a rise in the number of jobs available in these countries, but also a decrease in the number of people who can actually fill them. Additionally, the growth of technology has made it easier for people to move around the world, which has created new opportunities for those who are unable or unwilling to find work in their home country. These changing demographics will have a significant impact on both the workforce and social stability.

The power of a big idea: can change the way we think and see the world
Big ideas have the power to change the way we think and see the world. They can challenge our assumptions and help us to see things in new ways.


For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.



Big ideas can also change the way we see ourselves and our place in the world. The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.



So what is your big idea?
