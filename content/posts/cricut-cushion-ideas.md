Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.

Creative ideas: What are the most common ideas that come to people's minds when they think about creativity?
Creativity is something that people think about all the time. Some people think about it in terms of ideas, and some people think about it in terms of making things. Here are some of the most common ideas that come to people's minds when they think about creativity: 
1. Idea generation: When you have a lot of ideas, you can generate a lot of them. This means that you can come up with a lot of different ideas for things. 
2. Idea testing: Sometimes, you need to test out your ideas before you put them into action. This means that you need to see if someone else will be interested in what you have created. 
3. Inventiveness: People often say that creativity is something that comes easy to some people and hard to others. The truth is, it depends on how creative you are.

How do we create new ideas?
Innovation is the process of creating new ideas. It can be found in everything from technology to business to creativity. Here are four ways to create new ideas:

1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is a great way to get feedback and share your ideas with other people. You can also ask them for their opinion on a particular idea or topic.
2. Take on a challenge: Taking on a challenge is another way to create new ideas. Often, when you put yourself in an uncomfortable position, you’ll come up with better ideas than if you hadn’t taken the challenge.
3. Go beyond what people think is possible: Sometimes all it takes is going beyond what others think is possible to come up with better ideas.
