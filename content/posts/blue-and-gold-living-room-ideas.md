When to consider a big idea: What are the benefits and drawbacks?
When to consider a big idea is an important question to answer because it can determine the success or failure of your project. There are many factors to consider when deciding when a big idea is the best time to pursue, such as the feasibility of the idea, the potential impact of your ideas, and who will be benefited by your project. Here are four tips on when to consider a big idea:
1. Fidelity – Once you have determined that a big idea is feasible and beneficial, it is important to make sure that it does not conflict with any other projects or commitments you may have. If there are any issues or concerns about whether or not your project would contradict other interests or goals, it may be more difficult to bring your big idea up for consideration. This can lead to shelving the idea altogether or finding another way to make it a reality.

The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.
