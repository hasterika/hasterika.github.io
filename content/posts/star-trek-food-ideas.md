There is no right or wrong answer, though, as each person’s life will have its own unique meaning. What matters most is how you live your life and what makes you happy.

Differential value for art: What matters to individuals?
Creative art is one of the most subjective things a person can have. Some people enjoy looking at intricate designs or exploring different colors and textures, while others find pieces with simple designs more compelling. There isn’t one right way to look at art, and it doesn’t matter what someone’s individual values are. The important thing is that someone enjoys creative art, regardless of their individual beliefs.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can help you achieve success in any field, even if you don't have a lot of experience. They can also help you get your idea off the ground and into a full-blown business venture. Here are four benefits of having ideas: 
1. You'll be more confident when starting a new project. When you have an idea, it feels like there's something to believe in. This confidence will help you start and finish projects with greater efficiency, and it will make sure that your ideas actually turn into reality. 
2. You'll be more organized when brainstorming new ideas. Having an idea always means that there's a potential solution that you haven't considered before! This will enable you to come up with better ideas for projects, faster than if you didn't think about it at all.
