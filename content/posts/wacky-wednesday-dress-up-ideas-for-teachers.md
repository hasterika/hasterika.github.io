The Creative Process: How do we come up with new ideas?
Creativity is a process. It's not just a matter of coming up with new ideas. The creative process goes deeper than that. It's about how we come up with new ideas, and what we do to help ourselves get there.
There are different ways to approach creativity. Some people use brainstorming or problem-solving methods to come up with new ideas. Others rely on creative visualization or brainstorming techniques known as “brainstormsing.”

Whatever way you go, it's important to remember that creativity comes from the heart. We need to be open and allow ourselves to be inspired by what we see and hear around us. When we're able to let go of our habitual ways of thinking, we can start to create something new and amazing.

Functional innovation refers to making changes that improve the efficiency or performance of an organization such as increasing productivity or improving customer service. Organizational innovation refers to creating new ways for people to work together such as developing different productivity tools or coming up with unique ways for employees to communicate with each other.

Invention ideas are a huge help in improving the quality of our lives. They can be anything from making a new product to creating a new way of doing something. Sometimes, the idea is so simple that it can be done in an instant. Other times, the invention has taken years to perfect. It's important to find the right idea for the right person, and to make sure that it doesn't infringe on another person's patent or copyright.
