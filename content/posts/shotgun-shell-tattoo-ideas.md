Creativity is often described as the ability to come up with new and original ideas. However, creativity is more than just generating ideas – it’s about turning those ideas into reality.
Creativity is a process that can be both cognitive and emotional. It involves the generation of new ideas, as well as the ability to see those ideas through to completion. In order to be creative, you need to be open-minded and willing to take risks.

There are many different ways to be creative. Some people are born with natural creativity, while others have to work hard at it. However, anyone can learn to be more creative if they put their mind to it.
