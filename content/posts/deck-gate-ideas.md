Types of creativity:
Creativity is a broad term that can refer to any activity or feeling that leads to unique and original ideas. There are many different types of creativity, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: visual creativity, auditory creativity, and kinesthetic creativity.
Visual creativity is often measured by how much creative ideas the individual can come up with in a short amount of time. This type of creativity is often associated with art, fashion, and design. Visual artists may use various mediums such as paintings, sculptures, graphics, photography, and 3D printing to create their output.

Auditory creativity is often measured by how well the individual can generate new sounds. This type of creativity often occurs when someone listens to music or takes part in creative activities that produce new sounds.
