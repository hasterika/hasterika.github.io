The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences. For example, the Telephone was invented to make communication more efficient and cost-effective. Today, it plays an important role in our lives and economy.

There are several ways to help rise awareness about Invention and keep it alive.
