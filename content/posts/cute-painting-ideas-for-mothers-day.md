The creative process: How does one go about coming up with an invention?
Invention ideas come to us in all forms- written, verbal, or graphical. Some people start with the idea of what they want to create and then work backwards from there. Others have a pure invention idea that is completely new and has no precedent within the industry. There is no right or wrong way to come up with an invention, as long as it's creative and futuristic. The process of coming up with an invention begins by brainstorming different ideas on paper or on a computer. Once you've collected a few good ideas, it's time to get them down on paper or in your head for further thought. Once you've created some rough sketches, it's time for refinement and development. The next step is testing- doing research on the subject matter you're consideringbefore submitting your product to market.

Development: How do you stretch an idea into a reality?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea that either solves an existing problem or makes a new one. This can be done in many ways, but the most common way to come up with an invention is through brainstorming. By doing this, you will get ideas for products, services, or even ideas for how to improve your business.
There are a few things you need to do in order to make an invention a reality. The first is to come up with an idea that has potential commercial value. Second, make sure that the idea is unique and can’t be found on the market already. Third, find partners who are interested in developing and marketing the product or service. Finally, make sure that the product or service is easy and affordable to market and sell.
