Why big ideas are important
There are a number of reasons why big ideas are important. They can make ideas more likely to be implemented, they can help to lay the groundwork for new ideas, and they can help to build bridges between different parts of a company or office. Big ideas also tend to be more affordable and easier to execute than smaller ones, which can lead to increased success when trying to create change within an organization.
