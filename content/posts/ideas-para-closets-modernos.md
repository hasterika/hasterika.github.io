Business models: How do inventors develop their ideas?
Invention ideas are not always easy to come by, but they can be very valuable. They can help businesses of all sizes create new products or services that might not have been possible before. If you're thinking of coming up with an invention, it's important to think about how you would go about doing it. There are many different business models that inventors can develop their ideas in, and each one has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
One popular business model for inventor development is the Prototyping Method. This approach involves creating a model of a product or service that will allow for feedback and modification until it is ready to be released to the public. This allows inventors to test their ideas before they even release them to the public, which can help them immensely in terms of refining their concepts and getting more feedback from potential customers.

Goals: What are our goals for 2022?
The 2022 FIFA World Cup is coming up and there are a few things that everyone is focusing on. One of the things that seems to be getting a lot of attention is the goalkeepers’ competition. Many people are wondering what our goals for the tournament are, and whether or not they will be met. Here are some ideas for what our goals may be: 
1) We want to win the trophy. This has been a main goal of ours for quite some time now, and we believe that we can do it if we focus hard and take our game to new levels. 

2) We want to make sure that our players are given everything they need to be successful. We understand that some players may have had their best years already past them, so we want to help them recapture those formative years and continue making progress forward.
