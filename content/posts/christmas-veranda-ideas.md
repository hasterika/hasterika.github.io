History of Invention: How has invention evolved?
Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have existed. Evolution has played a role in shaping the way that Invention works, and how it is used. Invention has come in many forms, from simple methods to complex products. 
Some of the most important inventions include the wheel, the telephone, and the refrigerator. Each of these devices had a large impact on society and individual lives. The wheel was an important invention because it allowed people to move around more easily and build roads and bridges. The telephone was an important invention because it allowed people to communicate with each other without having to leave their homes or go to a library. The refrigerator was an important invention because it allowed people to store food without having to go into the kitchen. 

The importance of Invention cannot be understated.

The history of brainstorming
In the late 1940s, a group of psychologists working at Yale University began to study what is now known as brainstorming. The team, led by George Prince, was interested in finding out whether people could come up with more ideas if they worked on their own or in groups.
The psychologists conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to come up with as many ideas as possible for different topics. They found that people who worked on their own came up with fewer ideas than those who worked in groups.

The psychologists also found that the quality of the ideas generated was better when people worked in groups. This is because people are able to build on each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas as a result.

The findings of the Yale study sparked a lot of interest in the idea of brainstorming and its potential benefits.

Sometimes their creativity is in the form of new ways to look at old things, or a new way to approach an old problem. Creative people can be found all over the place, but there are two key types of creative people - those who come up with ideas and those who come up with products.
