What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something that you and others will enjoy. Whether it's a new idea for a product or service, or an innovative way of thinking about your work, creativity is essential to any business. Here are some creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a walk on the wild side: When it comes to creative ideas, there's nothing quite like spending time out on the open range. Find an abandoned quarry or animal pen for inspiration, and see what kind of new designs come into being as a result. 
2. Experiment with technology: Sometimes the most interesting things are the simplest things. Use technology to help you find new ways to express your ideas, and see what happens when you switch up your methods and channels.

The process of invention:
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that can be used in a business or other activity. It can take many different forms, but the basic process is the same: you come up with a solution to a problem and then create a prototype to see if it works.
Invention is an important part of any business, and it can help make things easier for people who are working hard to get things done. It also allows companies to keep their products and services fresh, and it makes it easier for people to find what they need when they need it.
