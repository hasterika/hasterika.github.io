How can you get creative and come up with new ideas?
Creativity is key to any success. If you can come up with new ideas, you’ll be on your way to becoming a more successful person. It’s not hard to come up with new ideas when you think about it. Just keep your mind open and don’t be afraid to try something new. Here are three tips for getting creative:
1. Start with small tasks. When you have some creativity going for you, it’s easier to get started on bigger projects. Try coming up with a few different ideas for a project and see which ones sound best before jumping into the full-blown creation process.

2. Take time with your ideas. Once you have your brainstorming materials, it’s important to take some time to really think about what you want your idea to say or do.

Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.
