What makes big ideas smart?
When it comes to big ideas, a little bit of thinking and creativity goes a long way. That’s why smarter ideas tend to be ones that are well-executed and scalable. Here are five ways to make your big ideas smarter:
1. Cut out the guesswork: By thinking ahead, you can remove any potential ambiguity or uncertainty. This will help you create a more organized plan and ensure that your idea is well-oiled from the get-go.

What are some bad ideas?
New ideas can be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how they're executed. Here are some bad ideas that could lead to negative outcomes: 
1. A new law that restricts freedom of speech. This law could lead to people being arrested and/or fined for expressing their opinions out of fear of retribution from the government. 
2. A plan to close all schools in the city in order to provide more public education. This plan would deprive children of instruction and would lead to an increase in crime rates in the city. 
3. Requiring businesses owners to install security cameras inside their businesses in order to catch thieves and criminals. This would require owners to spend money on something that isn't necessary and would also create an inconvenience for customers who need access to their businesses without having their business broken into.

The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is a key component of business success. It allows businesses to change and improve their products, services and processes in order to meet customer needs. However, innovation can also be a challenge. Sometimes, businesses find it difficult to identify the best ideas for new products or services and implement them successfully. This can lead to disappointment and even failure.
One way to overcome this challenge is by taking advantage of innovative technologies. Technologies that allow businesses to quickly create new products or services are often more successful than those that require more thought or effort. For example, online tools that help businesses track customer data are often more popular than those that involve physical visits or surveys.

Banks, insurance companies and other large organizations have used online tools for years in order to keep track of their customers’ spending habits and investments.
