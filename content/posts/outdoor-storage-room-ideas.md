1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before.

How to Take the Place of a Boss and Make More Money
Do you feel like your job isn't providing the financial stability that it used to? Are you sick of feeling like you're in control and always having to fight for your food, clothes, and housing? If so, there are a few new ideas out there that could help you take the place of a boss and make more money. Here are three:
1. Start your own business: many people feel like they have no choice but to work for somebody else because their income doesn't meet their needs. But if you start your own businesses, you can control your own income and set your own hours. This is an excellent way to make more money because it means you can set your own goals instead of working towards somebody else's.

2. become a freelancer: freelancing is the process of doing freelance jobs without getting paid for them.
