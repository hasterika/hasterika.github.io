Creative art has been around since the dawn of time. cave paintings and sculptures are some of the earliest examples of creative art. Throughout history, creative art has been used as a form of expression. It wasn’t until the Renaissance that artists began to sign their work.

Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were able to express their ideas and emotions through their artwork. The Renaissance was a time of great change and creativity.
