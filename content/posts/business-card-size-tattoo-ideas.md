Definition of creativity: The ability to come up with ideas, concepts, or solutions that are new, different, and innovative.
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas, concepts, or solutions that are new, different, and innovative.

This definition is helpful in understanding how creativity works and why it can be so important.
Creativity can be described as a process of coming up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions. It's important to note that creativity doesn't always have to come from within oneself – it can also be helped by external factors.

What is the definition of big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be difficult to come by. There are a few things that make big ideas successful, and those things depend on the individual. Some people find it easy to come up with big ideas, while others may have to work hard to come up with them.
The most important thing is that big ideas should have a clear vision and purpose. They need to be interesting and useful, and they should be something that people can be excited about. Once they’re developed, big ideas need to be abandoned if they don’t meet these requirements.

If you want to find out what makes big ideas successful, you need to ask yourself a few questions. What are your goals? What does the audience want? What do you think will make the idea interesting and user-friendly? Are you worried about potential roadblocks or problems?
