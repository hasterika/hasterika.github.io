Ideas are a dime a dozen these days, and many people are unsure of what to do with them. Some people think that new ideas are just to be tossed aside because they're not good enough, while others believe that there might be some great benefits to implementing a new idea. Here are three examples of why you might want to give a new idea a try: 
1. You may find an interesting application for the idea that you've been thinking about for years but never had the time or energy to pursue. 
2. You may have come up with an innovative way of doing something that has never been done before, and now it can be your go-to solution for any problem you face. 
3. An idea that is completely unique and has no equal on the market right now could lead to some really big changes in your industry or business.

Then consider installing a routing system for your cords and cables to keep them out of the way and easier to manage.
