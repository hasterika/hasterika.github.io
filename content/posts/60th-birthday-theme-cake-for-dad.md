2) The electric light bulb – This invention was first developed in 1879 by George Stephenson and John Wise. They created a device that could be plugged into an electrical outlet and use electricity to produce light.

3) The air-purifier – This invention was first developed in 1919 by Maynard Kelleher and Clifford Berry.
