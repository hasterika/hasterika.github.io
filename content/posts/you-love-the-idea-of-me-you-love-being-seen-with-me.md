Another theory suggests that creativity comes from the innate potential of people.

Ideas for blog content: What should be included?
Blog content is an important part of any website, and as such, it should be packed with ideas that will help customers find what they're looking for and leave satisfied customers. Here are a few tips on how to create engaging blog content:
1. Start by thinking about the topic of your blog post and what people might need or want to know about it. This will help you come up with topics that are both interesting and relevant to your audience. 
2. Make sure each post is well-planned and well-written. Even if you're not a writing expert, make sure your posts are easy to read and follow along with. 
3. Use pics, videos, etc to illustrate points or introduce your argument. This can help people see things from a different perspective and broaden their knowledge base in a way that doesn't require reading text.

Creativity and technology: What is the connection?
Creativity and technology are two of the most connected aspects of our lives. It seems that as we become more creative, our technology has also adapted to help us achieve our goals. Some of the newer ways that technology has helped us achieve creative outcomes include using computer-generated images to create realistic 3D models, and even using app development platforms to create custom software. The connection between creativity and technology is wide and varied, and it can be difficult to determine which angle is best suited for each situation.
