Conclusion: The importance of invention
Invention is extremely important because it allows humans to solve problems and improve their quality of life. Inventions can be small, like the wheel or the pencil, or they can be large, like the telephone or the internet. Whatever their size, inventions are always important because they make our lives better.
Without invention, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. We would not have fire or clothes or shelter. We would not have any of the comforts that we take for granted today. Invention is what makes us human and it is what separates us from the animals.

Invention is also important because it drives economic growth. Every new invention creates new jobs and new industries. It is invention that has made America the richest country in the world. And it is invention that will continue to make America great in the future.
