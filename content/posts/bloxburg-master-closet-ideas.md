5) Use natural light to boost productivity
Light is one of the most important things in a person's life. It can help you focus, read, and do your work better. There are many ways to use natural light to boost productivity. Here are 5 tips:
1) Get a window that opens up onto natural light. This will allow you to get plenty of exposure to the sun.
2) Use sunlight exposure clocks to time your work periods so you can work more effectively in the morning and at night.
3) Make use of windows with high-quality blinds or curtains that block out all light. This will keep you productive while working in darkness.
4) Use a desk lamp rather than traditional office lights. This will allow you to see what you're working on more clearly and avoid eyestrain.
5) Work in bright or bright daylight whenever possible.

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.
