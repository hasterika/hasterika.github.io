There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve.

What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:

2. Consider who your target market is.
