How does brainstroming work?
There is much debate surrounding the impact of brainstroming on cognitive functions, but there is little known about how it works. A recent study by scientists at the University of Utah found that when subjects are exposed to a burst of stimulation their brains release neurochemical substances that improve their cognitive performance. The study also showed that the release of these neurochemical substances was associated with increased activity in areas of the brain responsible for memory and attention.
