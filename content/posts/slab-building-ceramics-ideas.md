Pros and cons of doing the project
When it comes to doing DIY projects, there are pros and cons to each option. Some people may love the challenge of trying something new, while others may find it difficult to figure out what they're doing wrong the first time around.  So, which option is right for you? Here are seven tips on how to choose the right project for you.
1) Ask a friend or family member for help before starting: This is a great way to get started and have someone else hold your hand while you figure out what you need and where to start. This will also help avoid any surprises down the road.

2) Plan ahead: Don't try to do a project that's too much or too little at once. Make sure you have all of your supplies in advance so that you can get started without any hassles.
