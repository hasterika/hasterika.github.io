Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.
