Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.
