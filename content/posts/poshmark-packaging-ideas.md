The benefits of creativity
Creativity has been linked with improved mental health, better educational outcomes and even enhanced workplace performance.
A recent study found that people who engage in creative activities are more likely to report higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction.

 creativity can also lead to better educational outcomes. A study of 3,000 primary school children in the UK found that those who took part in creative activities had higher grades than those who didn’t.

And it’s not just students who benefit from being more creative – employees do too. A study of 1,500 workers found that those who had high levels of creativity were more engaged with their work and had lower levels of absenteeism.

Improvements you can get from a contractor: How can you choose the best option for renovating or upgrading your home?
There are many ways to improve the look of your home without spending a fortune. By following some simple DIY tips, you can make your home more comfortable and stylish. Here are four easy changes that you can make to your home in no time:
1. Add a new coat of paint. This is a relatively simple change that can update your home's appearance for a fraction of the cost of hiring a professional painter. Just select an appropriate color, mix it with some other old pieces in your house, and you're good to go.

2. Replenish the windows and door frames . A fresh coat of paint can brighten up an already aging building by updating the look and function of the glass elements. Not only will this add character to your property, but it can also be helpful in keeping cold weather out while heating up during summer months.
