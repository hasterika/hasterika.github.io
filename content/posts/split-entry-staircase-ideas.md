1. Create a custom desk with an old dresser
If you're like most people, your work desk is more a collection of random pieces of furniture than an organized working space. It's easy to get disorganized when you don't have a specific goal in mind when designing your desk. So how do you create an actual working space for yourself? One way is to find an old dresser and turn it into a custom desk. You can use the drawer space for storage, or simply use the top drawer as a place to put your computer, printer, and other office supplies. This project can be completed in just a few hours, and it's a great way to show off your skills as an architect.

Creative Solution: How do I come up with creative ideas?
Creative solutions come in all shapes and sizes, but the key is to find the right one for your needs. Here are a few tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1. Get inspired by other projects you’ve worked on. When you see creative solutions that are similar to yours, it can be easy to come up with ideas. This way, you won’t have to spend hours brainstorming until you find the right solution.

2. Be open to new ideas. It can be hard to be creative when everything else around you is familiar and cookie-cutter. But don’t be afraid to submit new ideas if they seem interesting or if someone else has already created a similar solution.

3. Take your time. Don’t get wrapped up in too much hurry when it comes to coming up with creative solutions.
