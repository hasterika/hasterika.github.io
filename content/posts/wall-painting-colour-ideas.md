The history of invention: How have some inventions been used and what benefits have they brought?
Invention ideas are a core part of the history of technology. From ancient times to the present, people have come up with new ways to do things. Some inventions have been helpful and others have not. The history of invention is full of examples of both. Here are three examples:
The incandescent light bulb was first invented in 1879 by Jewish inventor Samuel Morse. It used a filament that was heated by an oven to create light.

The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Phonograph Company president Edward Emmons and his brother George. They created a machine that could play sound files on a screen.

The modern computer was invented in 1947 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Bell Labs in New York City. It uses vacuum tubes to process information instead of magic numbers and letters like earlier computers did.

There is no one answer to the question of how innovation affects society. However, some key factors include: the ease with which new ideas can be born and the way that new methods of communication and production can be adopted. If these changes are not allowed to happen smoothly, society can become mired in stagnation, stagnation being a leading factor in economic decline and social unrest.

Patent applications: What are the most popular patent applications?
Patent applications are one of the most popular types of patent filings. They are used to protect ideas and inventions that may not be protected by other types of patents, like trade secret protection. 
 There are many different types of patent applications, but the most popular ones include: 
-Patent application for a new product 
-Patent application for a process or structure 
-Patent application for an invention 
There is no set number of patent applications that are filed in any given year, but it is generally safe to assume that there will be at least one type of patent application filed every month. This makes Patents a very important part of any development team as they can protect ideas and inventions from being ripped off by others.
