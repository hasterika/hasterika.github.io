Creative art is a type of artwork that is created from the artist’s own imagination, rather than being based on reality. It can be anything from a painting or sculpture, to a film or piece of music. Many people believe that creative art is more about expression and emotion, than it is about the final product.

The main points of the article
1. Ideas can be put into many different categories, but the three most common are: problems, solutions, and potential solutions.
2. Solutions to problems are often the easiest to find, and often have obvious solutions. However, there may be multiple possible solutions that fit the problem and still meet the goals of the solution.

3. Potential solutions are more difficult to determine, but can provide a more complete or accurate solution than either a solution or a problem. They can also be less likely to cause further problems down the road.
