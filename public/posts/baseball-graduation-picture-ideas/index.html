When artists have a personal connection to their creativity, they are more likely to express it.

For example, according as the work of Dr. Philippa Parris and Dr. Christopher Lasch shows, creative people are more willing to communicate their ideas and feelings than those who do not have such a relationship. However, the connection between artist and inventor does not always exist. In some cases, the two groups of people may be completely different in terms of creativity. Also, it is important to note that creativity does not come from having one’s ideas constantly tested or experimented with; it generally comes from being open-minded andCEPTIVE towards new ideas.\nKara's Party Ideas Back To School Teacher \u0026 Staff Luncheon | Kara's Source: pinterest.com\nkaraspartyideas.\nTECHNOLOGY: How do you think about the future of technology?
